In 2011, we went to Madrid. At that time, the medias were passing on
informations about the birth of the "spanish indignants": they were
describing us then a new form of social movement, an horizontal
movement, detached from any tradition. A movement using the social
networks to coordinate its actions, inspired by the events that had
taken place a few months earlier during the Arab spring.<br>
<br>
The Spaniards, they said, were taking the streets and occupying the
squares protesting against their government's politics. They didn't
want the rigor, the budget cuts or the austerity. They were raising
serious doubts as to the way their democracy was working, a democracy
they considered to be a vassal of the market, corrupt and disconnected
from the people. Those people had no leader, no party, no union. They
were just citizens. And they were willing to change democracy.
Intrigued by this phenomenon, we wanted to witness, to measure, to
evaluate and to understand by ourselves what really meant this
indignant movement, otherwise called the 15-M movement, that people
talked about with so much exaltation.<br>
<br>
During our first trip into the spanish capital, we weren't
dissapointed, literally seized by the energy that this free civil
society was realeasing. Everything we had been hearing was true,
something extraordinnary was going on in our spanish neighbor's back
yard. We just had to cross the Pyrenees to see it. An entire society,
seemed to stand, as one man. Mobilised to change the country, to handle
its own destiny. For the voices and the bodies standing in front of us,
everything was possible. The air was filled with hope. <br>
<br>
A year later, we returned to Madrid. The medias had stopped talking
about the indignants but the 15 M movement was still breathing. It was
just transformed. The squares were emptied, people had sunken faces but
they were still there, mobilised in differents ways and in a more
precise way. Organisations, communities, new groups - still outside any
party and traditional union - had taken over the "indignado" movement.
But this time it was not the energy and that will to fight, that drew
our attention. What shoked us most, during this second journey, was the
violence of the austerity policies carried by the conservative Mariano
Rajoy's government. All around us people were dismissed, budgets were
cut, companies were privatised. Entire families were thrown out of
their homes every day. The lines for the soup kitchens were every day
longer. The State was shrinking. The young people were massivley
leaving the country hoping to find salvation abroad. The health staff,
the education staff, the police staff and most of the public services
were in unlimited strike. The demonstrations had become the common lot
of the Spaniards and the Parliament, barricaded, looked like a citadel
under siege. madrid seemed wounded, ravaged. Under a state of siege.<br>
<br>
These two journeys and these two impressions, gave birth to the idea of
making the webdocumentary NO ES UNA CRISIS. Through it, we wish to
bring a dual outlook on the crisis, the dual outlook we have
experimented during our two stays in Madrid. This way, we wish to show
the state of a european capital constrained to a severe austerity
policy, but also to reveal how a civil society can mobilize,
transcending all ages, social classes or politcal believes, to resist
to something that looks a lot like a stampede, and to rethink
democracy. In other words, we wish to show a capital hit by rigor and
galvanized by a spirit of revolt. <br>
