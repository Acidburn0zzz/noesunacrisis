No Es Una Crisis
================

This is the source code for the web-documentary **No Es Una Crisis**, produced by *La Société Des Apaches* in 2013.

- Direct access to HTML5 version : http://framasoft-streaming2.rezopole.net/html5/

The ressources of the original web-documentary are fully CC By-Sa, but unfortunately the diffusion format is in Flash, so the webdoc couldn't be seen on many devices (tablets, smartphones, GNU/Linux and, of course, any devices where Adobe Flash Player is not installed).

So, in december 2013, the french non-governmental organisation *Framasoft* decided to propose an alternative version in HTML5, with the challenge to make it in one week-end (between some pizzas and lot of beers).

The code in this repository is quite ugly (but, hey, did I mentionned that there was **a lot** of beers ?) and it could be easely improved, so do not hesitate to propose improvements from opening issues or offering pull-requests.
