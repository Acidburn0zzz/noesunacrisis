00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:04,815
I am Ramón Muñoz, I've been a journalist
for more than 20 years,

2
00:00:04,816 --> 00:00:07,157
I generally write in
the Economy section.

3
00:00:07,158 --> 00:00:10,366
I work for El País,

4
00:00:10,367 --> 00:00:13,787
and I just wrote a book that's called
"Spain: a third world destination",

5
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:18,265
where I expose serious
problems of Spanish society.

6
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:27,090
Everybody says that the Spanish crisis
is due to the real estate bubble.

7
00:00:27,091 --> 00:00:31,191
I say the real estate bubble is not
a cause, but a consequence.

8
00:00:31,192 --> 00:00:35,182
It was the only way left
for Spain to grow,

9
00:00:35,183 --> 00:00:37,352
and we grew a lot.

10
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:43,882
Even today, real estate is all we
have left to grow.

11
00:00:43,883 --> 00:00:48,723
Because we have no industry.
I believe that's the origin of this crisis :

12
00:00:48,724 --> 00:00:53,481
we dismantled all our national industry.
We absolutely don't produce anything.

13
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:57,998
Our great international firms, that everyone
here is bragging about, and that you all know,

14
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:01,821
such as the famous 
Inditex, Zara.

15
00:01:02,993 --> 00:01:07,260
It's a very famous brand, but it doesn't produce
anything in Spain. Absolutely nothing !

16
00:01:07,961 --> 00:01:12,309
Sooner or later, this creates an illusion :
if you don't produce anything,

17
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:16,636
everything is imported low cost from
abroad. And for a while, it works.

18
00:01:16,637 --> 00:01:19,834
Until reality gets to you. The truth is that
if you don't have any production,

19
00:01:19,835 --> 00:01:23,551
sooner or later, you will have the same
problem as Spain : everybody becomes unemployed.

20
00:01:26,694 --> 00:01:31,161
Property eviction is the most painful
phenomenon, which shows that

21
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:35,546
Spain, as I say in my book,
is heading towards the third world.

22
00:01:35,547 --> 00:01:41,536
This is exactly what happened
in some countries in Latin America,

23
00:01:41,537 --> 00:01:45,038
where people ended up living
in substandard places

24
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:51,797
for which they don't pay taxes,
and well... shantytowns, "favelas".

25
00:01:52,251 --> 00:01:54,952
I think the same phenomenon
will happen in Spain.

26
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:56,923
I may seem alarmist.

27
00:01:56,924 --> 00:02:04,715
When I mention third world, I don't have in mind Africa,
with children covered with flies.

28
00:02:04,716 --> 00:02:09,251
It's poverty that every Spanish 
or French tourist can see

29
00:02:09,652 --> 00:02:13,619
when they go to South America for example,
or in some Asian countries.

30
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:20,137
There you can see people with a higher life
standard than what we have in Europe,

31
00:02:20,138 --> 00:02:27,619
but next to that you see the "favelas"
or the shantytowns where nobody wants to go.

32
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,439
But that's where the majority is.

33
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,288
We experienced this situation in Spain in the 60's,
we called it the shacks.

34
00:02:34,323 --> 00:02:36,767
I think we will go back
to this situation.

35
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:43,241
It sounds hard, it sounds alarmist,
some even call me apocalyptic.

36
00:02:43,242 --> 00:02:49,005
But I invite them to look at
what happened these past four years.

37
00:02:49,006 --> 00:02:52,549
Capitalism isn't afraid anymore,
that's for sure.

38
00:02:53,581 --> 00:02:58,122
This is why we started
to decline, not just in Spain,

39
00:02:58,123 --> 00:03:01,233
but in the whole Western world,
on our labour and social rights.

40
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:04,959
This crisis, this brutal recession,

41
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:10,191
I don't think it's a crisis but a true depression
that will go beyond the one of 1929.

42
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:17,684
It may be the perfect excuse to recreate
the 19th century society,

43
00:03:17,685 --> 00:03:22,493
a society of rich and poor people, with wifi and
smartphones, but still with rich and poor people.

44
00:03:26,632 --> 00:03:31,827
I don't believe that a devaluation is a solution,
devaluation only leads to economic depression.

45
00:03:31,828 --> 00:03:38,074
I don't believe in the Keynesian
solution with more public expenses,

46
00:03:38,075 --> 00:03:41,820
because you need to have this money
and nobody will loan it to you.

47
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:45,191
And I don't believe 
in the utopian solutions either,

48
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,340
thinking that if you go to the street,
like Puerta del Sol,

49
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,995
and agitate your hands,
everything will be solved,

50
00:03:51,996 --> 00:03:56,649
because the rich people will feel sorry
for you and they will pay for your living.

51
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,494
As I see things, there's no
way out beside resignation,

52
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:03,717
and knowing that we'll go back
to a poverty we are not used to.
