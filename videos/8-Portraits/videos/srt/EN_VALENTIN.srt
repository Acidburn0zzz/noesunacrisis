1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,470
My name is Valentin, I'm 21 years old.
I've been in Spain for four years.

2
00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:12,700
I militate for "Juventud sin Futuro" and I'm studying
political science at the Complutense University.

3
00:00:15,367 --> 00:00:20,058
There's no doubt I was
influenced by my parents.

4
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:28,548
My mother is a teacher and she
has always been very sensitive

5
00:00:28,549 --> 00:00:32,982
to all the movements for the preservation
of the education's good conditions,

6
00:00:32,983 --> 00:00:38,568
or at least those I believe to be good :
public, opened to everybody, free.

7
00:00:38,569 --> 00:00:45,361
Since I was very young, my mother took me
to demonstrations, to these kinds of protests,

8
00:00:45,362 --> 00:00:54,115
and this is how I ended up participating in France to the movement
against the CPE (First Job Contract).

9
00:00:54,116 --> 00:00:59,801
The movement against the CPE had a real great
impact on me, because I was 15 at that time.

10
00:01:00,697 --> 00:01:07,278
It was the first time I saw 
occupied high schools,

11
00:01:07,279 --> 00:01:10,915
teachers and students 
together in the street.

12
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:19,878
The demonstrations against the extreme-right-wing
in 2002 had an impact on me too.

13
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:26,764
I was young at that time, I was 11 !

14
00:01:28,234 --> 00:01:34,780
I was 11 but I remember it well,
all those people in the street...

15
00:01:34,781 --> 00:01:38,490
I think all this contributed to
 my interest for political theory,

16
00:01:38,491 --> 00:01:45,074
and then I tried to find a daily practice,
a practice that could change things.

17
00:01:45,075 --> 00:01:52,411
I graduated from high school in France,
I was in an international high school,

18
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:56,860
a bilingual high school
with Spanish classes.

19
00:01:56,861 --> 00:02:03,412
I graduated with a good
knowledge of Spanish

20
00:02:03,413 --> 00:02:07,190
and I thought to myself
"why wouldn't I use it" ?

21
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:11,002
When I came here to the university,
three years ago,

22
00:02:11,003 --> 00:02:15,703
I used to pay 600 euros
for an academic year.

23
00:02:15,704 --> 00:02:20,384
This year, out of the ten classes
we're supposed to take a year,

24
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:26,353
I only took seven and I'm already
paying 900 euros of university fees.

25
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:30,447
Meaning that I'm paying 300 euros
more with three less classes.

26
00:02:31,846 --> 00:02:39,929
That's why I can't pay for an apartment
so I decided to occupy one.

27
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:48,344
There are many new structures
that are created, social centers for example,

28
00:02:48,345 --> 00:02:55,853
and also many others that are occupied
to give people a place to stay.

29
00:02:55,854 --> 00:03:00,152
That gives a housing solution
to people that have no alternative.

30
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:04,879
People have to get used
to living with less things,

31
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:09,241
because life standards
decreased a lot.

32
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:13,816
People can't live as they used to,
that's for sure. And it's true, I think,

33
00:03:13,817 --> 00:03:19,996
that people are trying to find an answer,
a solution to this situation,

34
00:03:19,997 --> 00:03:26,357
so that they can live not only
in dignity but even in happiness.

35
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:34,847
I don't think the solution is going up in the mountains
to raise goats with two coats and one pair of boots.

36
00:03:36,015 --> 00:03:43,314
But I do think the real solution is
sharing everything we can have,

37
00:03:43,315 --> 00:03:49,772
everything we own, everything
we create, everything we know.

38
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:54,409
So I don't know, what I would like
very much is quite difficult to do.

39
00:03:54,410 --> 00:04:02,662
At least what I try to do personally and with
the others is to give all the necessary strength

40
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:08,852
to this parallel organization,
this social and political organization.

41
00:04:08,853 --> 00:04:14,986
Meaning that we try to defend a maximum of things
that they are trying to take away from us.
