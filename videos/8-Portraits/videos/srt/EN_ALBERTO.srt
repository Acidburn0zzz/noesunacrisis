1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,066
I am Alberto Garzón Espinosa,
Congressman for the United Left party,

2
00:00:03,067 --> 00:00:09,053
an economist, and I represent the Economy,
Finance and Budget Commission in Parliament.

3
00:00:09,054 --> 00:00:14,947
I am also an activist of the 15M movement
and of social movements for real democracy.

4
00:00:17,301 --> 00:00:22,998
Saying that the financial entities need to be rescued
is a political and ideological choice.

5
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:28,747
In order to save the financial entities you must
guarantee that they can pay the debt.

6
00:00:28,748 --> 00:00:34,225
To guarantee that they can pay the debt, wrong austerity
measures and budget cuts are imposed.

7
00:00:34,226 --> 00:00:38,457
But the real purpose of all this
is to change this model of society.

8
00:00:38,458 --> 00:00:43,110
Let's say that the cuts are just an excuse.
The goal is to change the model of society,

9
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:50,074
by establishing a less developed economy
that could be internationally competitive,

10
00:00:50,075 --> 00:00:55,192
in a world where there's a productive and financial globalizing
and where we all compete with each other.

11
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:57,654
Many are guilty.
Many are responsible.

12
00:00:57,655 --> 00:01:01,403
We have names, names of individuals

13
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:07,355
but also institutions, like political parties,
that consolidate this broken model.

14
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:11,639
And most of all we have to keep in mind
that capitalism itself is at death's door.

15
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,873
Capitalism is collapsing and with it,
all those who supported that vision of capitalism,

16
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:22,133
the need of a real estate bubble,
the need of living off of constructions.

17
00:01:22,134 --> 00:01:28,500
All those who took part in this illusion
and created the real estate bubble,

18
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:34,122
are responsible for having maintained
this model and for the situation we are now in.

19
00:01:34,123 --> 00:01:38,758
There are people responsible among
the politicians and among the bankers.

20
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:46,159
There are others at fault but most of all,
it is the internal dynamic of a system.

21
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:49,647
An irrational system that needs to grow,
to grow and to grow again and again.

22
00:01:49,648 --> 00:01:56,116
In Spain the only way they found to make
capitalism grow, was construction.

23
00:01:56,117 --> 00:02:05,230
So capitalism needs corruption, connections,
client networks, in order to survive.

24
00:02:05,231 --> 00:02:09,282
I live in Málaga, in the South of Spain,
in a very humble neighborhood.

25
00:02:09,283 --> 00:02:12,148
In front of my house
there's an organization

26
00:02:12,149 --> 00:02:15,850
that gives a thousand sandwiches every evening 
so that people have something to eat.

27
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:17,605
Those people 
are not beggars.

28
00:02:17,606 --> 00:02:21,399
Let's say physically they don't look like beggars.
They are people like you and me.

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:27,418
We could be there too, waiting in line,
because poverty has a different face now.

30
00:02:27,419 --> 00:02:32,440
The middle class is disappearing and
the population is quickly getting poorer.

31
00:02:32,441 --> 00:02:36,835
And the worst of all is that
the government doesn't do anything.

32
00:02:36,836 --> 00:02:42,394
This is a critical situation, people are hungry,
people kill themselves because they loose their homes.

33
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:47,430
A social emergency situation, maybe not as bad as
in Greece, but we're heading towards the same direction.

34
00:02:47,431 --> 00:02:53,959
And this is why we have to be radical
in an etymological way : we must go to the roots of the problem.

35
00:02:54,012 --> 00:02:57,646
Because if you only make up for the problems,
then you become an alibi.

36
00:02:57,647 --> 00:03:01,013
We have a structural problem here 
and we need to solve it starting with its roots.

37
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:05,781
We need for the financial system to be public,
same as for the housing management.

38
00:03:05,782 --> 00:03:11,712
With all the empty buildings we can have a public
housing program with a rent less than 30% of the income,

39
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:15,850
so that people can have access to a home,
which is now a major problem.

40
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:19,234
But in order to do that,
we have to let the banks collapse,

41
00:03:19,235 --> 00:03:23,379
then nationalize them and forget
about the private debt.

42
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:26,375
This could lead to severe consequences,

43
00:03:26,376 --> 00:03:29,620
for Germany, for France
and for the international financial system.

44
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:33,746
But we are in a critical situation
where the priority is our families,

45
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:37,901
the priority is the people not the banks
and not rich people's businesses.

46
00:03:41,242 --> 00:03:46,158
History in Latin America for example,
showed us that you can break up with the IMF

47
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,113
and with the international institutions

48
00:03:49,114 --> 00:03:52,940
and that you can create an alternative
economic and political system.

49
00:03:52,975 --> 00:03:55,745
A new Constitution and a new
kind of economy.

50
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:59,273
We can do things, we can put resources
in the hands of the people.

51
00:03:59,274 --> 00:04:02,760
But we need a first step.
The first step is gathering strengths.

52
00:04:02,761 --> 00:04:07,250
People have to be aware of the fact
that this is their project,

53
00:04:07,251 --> 00:04:11,907
not just a theorical project and
they have to make it their own.

54
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:17,246
In situations like this, history of economy has
unfortunately given us some bad examples

55
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:21,572
of very serious crisis that in some
cases ended up with a war.

56
00:04:21,573 --> 00:04:27,088
But I think we've learned a lot from history
and we won't do the same mistakes again.

57
00:04:27,089 --> 00:04:31,255
We are not Germany
nor are we Europe of the '30.

58
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:37,040
We are more like Latin America in the 80's and 90's,
that broke up with the international institutions

59
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,716
to build a democratic project.
