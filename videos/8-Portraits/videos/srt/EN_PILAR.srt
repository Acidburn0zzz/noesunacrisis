1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:04,802
My name is Pilar Goytre. I am 65 years old
and I just retired.

2
00:00:04,803 --> 00:00:08,147
I have three children
and three grandchildren.

3
00:00:08,148 --> 00:00:15,102
I dedicate myself today
to the Yayoflautas movement.

4
00:00:15,103 --> 00:00:23,966
I am happy to be a Yayoflauta. We'll fight to find a way
out of what is happening in this country.

5
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:30,185
My father was a military and my mother
didn't work, she stayed at home.

6
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:33,960
We were nine brothers and sisters
and we are all still alive.

7
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:37,007
Since we were a lot in the house,
and my father was only a military,

8
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:41,138
only the boys 
got to have a career.

9
00:00:41,139 --> 00:00:48,380
There was not enough money to allow girls
to have a career so we had to look for work.

10
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:54,333
I studied to be a secretary and finally
things turned out quite well for me.

11
00:00:54,334 --> 00:01:00,755
I started to work for a lawyer,
then I worked for El País for 18 years.

12
00:01:01,756 --> 00:01:10,096
After that, for about 20 years...
no, less... 18 years,

13
00:01:10,097 --> 00:01:13,958
I worked for a cancer
treatment center.

14
00:01:16,553 --> 00:01:22,442
I can talk about my Franco period.
I only got to see the end of the Franco period.

15
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:28,671
I was still little and I remember
people still had ration cards.

16
00:01:28,672 --> 00:01:32,668
You had to go with the card
and they gave you food.

17
00:01:32,669 --> 00:01:41,132
When we went to the movies, they made you see
the "Nodo" before the movie started.

18
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:47,205
There was no television but you had to see the "Nodo" before
you watched the movie, whether you liked it or not.

19
00:01:47,206 --> 00:01:51,465
Franco had a dam built, Franco
was fantastic, whatever !

20
00:01:51,466 --> 00:01:56,020
He was such a brillant guy, he was so nice !
It was endless,

21
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:59,301
every time you went to the movies
they were showing this.

22
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:02,373
Therefore you were surrounded
by propaganda.

23
00:02:02,374 --> 00:02:07,510
In my house we couldn't talk politics.
It was better to avoid it.

24
00:02:07,511 --> 00:02:11,196
We, the younger ones were more left-wing
while the older ones were right-wing.

25
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:17,291
And we were always arguing about it !
So we preferred not to talk about politics and religion.

26
00:02:21,323 --> 00:02:25,833
I was older when Franco died.

27
00:02:25,834 --> 00:02:29,208
I was already working for
El País, I remember that.

28
00:02:34,138 --> 00:02:40,659
To me and my group of friends
it was a great joy.

29
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:46,830
It was a moment of liberation. Besides the uncertainty
for the future, I think it was a moment of liberation.

30
00:02:50,369 --> 00:02:57,255
We weren't afraid anymore. That fear
we all had was over now.

31
00:02:57,256 --> 00:03:01,731
We didn't know what would happen
but we had to go on.

32
00:03:01,732 --> 00:03:05,647
It was a little bit like a revolution.
A social revolution !

33
00:03:07,483 --> 00:03:11,169
So it was an interesting time,
political parties started to be founded,

34
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:17,285
we had the first elections in Spain, the first democratic
elections that Adolfo Suárez won.

35
00:03:20,606 --> 00:03:24,378
The truth is that all of us took
a deep breath, we grew up !

36
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:32,213
Spain was changing, it wasn't that grey and sad
country anymore, as it was during the Franco period.

37
00:03:32,214 --> 00:03:35,537
Light was coming in
from all around us.

38
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:50,701
What happened after, I think
politicians didn't even realize it,

39
00:03:50,702 --> 00:03:54,894
maybe because of the lack of experience
as we hadn't had democracy before,

40
00:03:54,895 --> 00:04:00,079
politicians didn't have that experience.
Political parties didn't know what to do,

41
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,483
and I think they didn't know
how to look a little bit further.

42
00:04:05,484 --> 00:04:13,107
They saw the spectacular moment :
the moment of freedom, of going forward,

43
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:17,659
of economic growth,
everything was fantastic.

44
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:24,012
But they didn't think about after.
That's why we had this crisis

45
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:28,483
that we couldn't handle.

46
00:04:28,484 --> 00:04:32,319
I think that the
politicians were wrong,

47
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:38,008
the right-wing ones and the left-wing ones.
They all did things wrong.
