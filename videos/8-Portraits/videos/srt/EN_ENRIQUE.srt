00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,302
I am Enrique Dans. I am a teacher at
the IE Business School. I'm 47 years old.

2
00:00:07,938 --> 00:00:13,277
In Spain, we have several years
of activism in the technological sector.

3
00:00:13,278 --> 00:00:20,184
There were a lot of strong reactions
on Internet against laws,

4
00:00:20,185 --> 00:00:25,289
against the social and
information service law,

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:30,850
against the license-fee, asking for
flat-rates for example.

6
00:00:30,885 --> 00:00:38,245
These movements have been developed
over the years on the Internet.

7
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:48,372
And people now talk about it on the Internet,
posting things and sometimes it reaches the medias.

8
00:00:48,373 --> 00:00:53,135
But their attempts failed
to evolve into street protests,

9
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:59,604
even for the most important ones.

10
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:08,308
The Sinde law was like a detonator to me.
It happened after those years of activism

11
00:01:08,309 --> 00:01:16,855
and made people see that politicians
don't respond to people's needs,

12
00:01:16,856 --> 00:01:23,334
that they theoretically represent. Instead
they defend the interests of an economic lobby,

13
00:01:23,335 --> 00:01:27,512
in this case the copy-right lobby,
the lobby of the "artists".

14
00:01:27,513 --> 00:01:31,802
This law appears as a liberty
killer and dangerous law,

15
00:01:31,803 --> 00:01:38,350
that allows them to shut down any web page.
So there was a strong reaction to that.

16
00:01:38,351 --> 00:01:44,018
From that point on, a movement
started, to which I contributed,

17
00:01:44,019 --> 00:01:48,980
that we called, "Don't vote for them", don't vote
for the parties that support the Sinde law.

18
00:01:51,846 --> 00:01:57,422
In the "No les votes" group we were actually
six or seven people, and we weren't people of the street,

19
00:01:57,423 --> 00:02:01,333
We were people of the Internet :
there were two teachers,

20
00:02:01,334 --> 00:02:05,036
three lawyers, one new
technologies business owner.

21
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:11,961
People you don't expect to organize a street
demonstration because we didn't know how to do that.

22
00:02:11,962 --> 00:02:14,891
But we were very active
on the Internet.

23
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:20,342
And then we went to this demonstration,
I think we all went.

24
00:02:20,343 --> 00:02:28,023
but after we were more
in a position of observers.

25
00:02:28,024 --> 00:02:32,928
I was interested in the influence of technology
on all of that but nothing more.

26
00:02:32,929 --> 00:02:39,596
I was first surprised by the number of people present there.
Then, by the ability of organizing things,

27
00:02:39,597 --> 00:02:45,081
I found myself in a very organized demonstration
in which you could find all kinds of people,

28
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:51,308
there were people responsible for organizing.

29
00:02:51,309 --> 00:03:00,320
And all that crowd of course ! I went to Cibeles
where people were going to Puerta del Sol !

30
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:07,026
It was not really a moving demonstration
but more an occupying demonstration.

31
00:03:07,027 --> 00:03:10,371
I had never seen
a protest like that before.

32
00:03:10,372 --> 00:03:17,553
And then, I had the  pleasant surprise of seeing 
a great diversity of people there.

33
00:03:17,554 --> 00:03:22,222
I am a teacher in a business school,
I am a liberal,

34
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:29,713
not a radical one, not a conservative,
but I tend to be liberal.

35
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:34,697
I found myself there next to people
from anarchist movements, next to communists...

36
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:40,137
There were people of all ages...
students from my business school,

37
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:44,996
people from the right wing, left wing,
a little bit of everything. That really draw my attention.

38
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:54,198
I think Internet has a lot of influence
on democracy.

39
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:57,435
We have to keep that in mind while thinking
about the evolution of democracy.

40
00:03:57,436 --> 00:04:03,265
That doesn't mean we are ready
to go from a representative democracy

41
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:08,106
to a direct, participative democracy.
I don't think we are there yet.

42
00:04:08,107 --> 00:04:16,099
But I do think that Internet is something that allows
us to collect people's will.

43
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:21,732
And then, another very important element is transparency.
Internet allows transparency.

44
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:29,271
And that's what I want as a citizen. I want those who
represent me to do it an a completely transparent way.
