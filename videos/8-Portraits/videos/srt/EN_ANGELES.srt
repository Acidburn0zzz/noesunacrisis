1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,182
I am Ángeles Diez Rodriguez,

2
00:00:02,183 --> 00:00:07,382
I am a sociology teacher
at the Complutense University.

3
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:13,484
I participated in the birth of the movement,
or the symptom,

4
00:00:13,485 --> 00:00:16,907
or the hope the 15M
represents for this country.

5
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:26,962
The Wert decree, which is a law
for the education sector,

6
00:00:26,963 --> 00:00:31,223
affected it on every level :
primary, secondary and university.

7
00:00:31,224 --> 00:00:38,313
In the university's case,
this law established a new model.

8
00:00:38,314 --> 00:00:46,522
A liberal model that tries to make
public university "profitable".

9
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:50,208
My reaction to that was :
"how can we react in the university ?".

10
00:00:50,209 --> 00:00:54,593
We made a call with four other people
from the political science college,

11
00:00:54,594 --> 00:01:02,097
and we convened an assembly.
A horizontal assembly.

12
00:01:02,098 --> 00:01:07,633
As the labour unions weren't doing anything
about it, we convened the assembly.

13
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:12,393
And we started talking
about what was happening.

14
00:01:12,394 --> 00:01:17,788
we decided to get together in a
permanent assembly called the Workers Platform,

15
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:22,633
not an official assembly, because nothing
was made official, but following the 15M model.

16
00:01:22,634 --> 00:01:27,409
We didn't want to become official,
we just wanted to put pressure on the unions,

17
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:36,133
to be united, to meet from time to time.
Little by little, step by step we became a resistance.

18
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,616
We try to analyze the 15M
as if it were a typical movement.

19
00:01:45,617 --> 00:01:50,715
From what I see, it's not a movement.
I call it a symptom.

20
00:01:50,716 --> 00:01:55,209
A symptom that responds to a trauma,
unsolved by the transition.

21
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:01,423
And that trauma is related to the civil war
and all the problems related to it.

22
00:02:01,424 --> 00:02:08,538
The transition was only a fiction,
an illusion that made people think...

23
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:14,618
I was very little but my parents,  for example...
it made them believe that they could have democracy back,

24
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:18,526
that institutions could 
really be changed,

25
00:02:18,527 --> 00:02:26,838
that the land could be shared,that there would
be work and every right could be secured.

26
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:29,852
And we realized it couldn't,
it wasn't like that.

27
00:02:29,853 --> 00:02:38,316
When the crisis began in 2008, people were striken
by a very strong economic depression.

28
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:46,040
Despite that, the 15M went out on the street
with a political claim: "they don't represent us !"

29
00:02:46,441 --> 00:02:51,950
And to me this is very important because
it wasn't a corporative claim saying

30
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:56,018
"I've just been fired",
or "my rights are being taken from me".

31
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:02,441
The people went out on the street with the idea of :
"they are calling this democracy, but this isn't one"

32
00:03:04,494 --> 00:03:09,936
The young people now don't have homes, they don't have
jobs and probably won't have a future.

33
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:14,640
But they do have something that the other
generations, not so young, don't have.

34
00:03:14,641 --> 00:03:17,642
They have their youth.

35
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:23,774
And that youth is an asset that allows
them to get out of this country,

36
00:03:23,775 --> 00:03:30,090
to fight, to have enough energy
to turn around this country.

37
00:03:30,091 --> 00:03:35,530
But there is an entire generation
of 50 or 60 year olds,

38
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:40,238
that are left without a job
and with a family to support.

39
00:03:40,273 --> 00:03:46,628
That generation is being
murdered by this model.

40
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:49,639
The situation is very complicated to me,

41
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:59,644
because on one hand I have to tell the best
students that they won't find a job here,

42
00:03:59,645 --> 00:04:07,802
but on the other hand, from a political point of view,
I tell them to stay and fight here, in this country.

43
00:04:07,803 --> 00:04:11,232
Because if there's no one here to fight
for change, this country is going to collapse.

44
00:04:13,896 --> 00:04:19,664
I think the best solution
 is the claim :

45
00:04:19,665 --> 00:04:26,080
"we can change things
if we unite and fight"

46
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:35,691
The best thing the movement has given
to older generations and to my generation

47
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:40,623
is the feeling that
 everything isn't lost.
