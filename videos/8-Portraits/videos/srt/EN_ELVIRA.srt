00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,046
My name is Elvira Méndez Pinedo,
I work as a law professor at the University of Iceland,

2
00:00:06,047 --> 00:00:13,106
I just published an essay called
"The vikings' revolution - the citizens' victory".

3
00:00:15,293 --> 00:00:20,431
In October 2008 Iceland
was in a state of shock.

4
00:00:21,732 --> 00:00:27,129
In a week or ten days, we went from
being paradise on earth,

5
00:00:27,130 --> 00:00:37,170
the country with the highest human developmental index in the world,
with an enviable health system, education,

6
00:00:37,171 --> 00:00:42,048
I won't mention the social services because they are not
even as generous as in other Scandinavian countries.

7
00:00:42,049 --> 00:00:50,349
So we went from being a leader of
the Western world, to bankruptcy.

8
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,437
How did our financial system crash ?

9
00:00:54,438 --> 00:01:01,087
The three major banks, 85% of the
national banking, went bankrupt.

10
00:01:01,088 --> 00:01:10,215
and all the sudden the Government and
the Parliament let us down.

11
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:15,325
Let's say that this was a financial crisis that
quickly turned into an economic crisis,

12
00:01:15,326 --> 00:01:18,740
a political crisis, a social crisis :
an existential crisis.

13
00:01:22,223 --> 00:01:26,288
Why do revolutions work ?
Why did it work in Iceland ?

14
00:01:26,889 --> 00:01:32,881
First there's the responsibility of the political,
economic, and financial elite of this country :

15
00:01:32,882 --> 00:01:37,618
We must ask them to take that responsibility
and not allow their actions to remain unpunished.

16
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:45,966
And then, more importantly, the role
played by the active citizens, that got involved,

17
00:01:45,967 --> 00:01:53,641
that decided it was no longer enough to stay
at home and vote every four years.

18
00:01:55,204 --> 00:01:59,246
In Iceland, the average age is 36 years old.
It's a very young country,

19
00:01:59,247 --> 00:02:08,488
with a high technological and internet education.
93 to 95% of homes have Internet.

20
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:14,252
This level of access to information
and of technological education

21
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:18,028
means that an online project 
can represent the entire population.

22
00:02:18,029 --> 00:02:24,287
The project of Constitution was first written by consensus,
by an assembly later called the Constitutional Council,

23
00:02:24,288 --> 00:02:34,434
and then directly submitted
online to citizens.

24
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:41,339
This project was submitted online,
so that everybody could update it on Twitter,

25
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:45,484
on Facebook, as if it were an open
code system, like Wikipedia.

26
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:52,209
There was no such thing as an Icelandic paradise
before the crisis, nor an Icelandic hell after that,

27
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:56,138
nor the economic miracle
as they sell it to us now.

28
00:02:56,139 --> 00:02:59,878
There's light and shadow, things that
work well and others that don't.

29
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,274
But the most important thing is that
we citizens, took control of our destiny.

30
00:03:03,275 --> 00:03:08,391
It proved that it's possible
to change things politically,

31
00:03:08,392 --> 00:03:15,092
that we can demand this responsability, this change
of course and this active role of the population,

32
00:03:15,093 --> 00:03:17,307
but we have to work for it.
