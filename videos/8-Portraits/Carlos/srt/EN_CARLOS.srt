00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:05,378
I am Carlos Taibo, a political science teacher
at the Independent University of Madrid.

2
00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:10,543
For many years I've been closed
to the alternative unions movement,

3
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:18,449
and lately to the 15M movement,
about which I wrote three books.

4
00:00:21,801 --> 00:00:28,122
The phrase "Spain is a great country", has always been repeated
by different Spanish Prime Ministers,

5
00:00:28,137 --> 00:00:31,711
aspecially in times of crisis.

6
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:37,271
What surprises me in that phrase
is the collective impetus it implies,

7
00:00:37,272 --> 00:00:41,942
in a country where the collective dimension
has always been marginalized, annihilated.

8
00:00:41,943 --> 00:00:49,895
Rhetorically speaking, we invoke the "collective" for the purpose
of a general mobilization in the economic field.

9
00:00:50,896 --> 00:00:54,247
The myth of a "great country"
is based on other mythes :

10
00:00:54,248 --> 00:01:00,415
the myth of a peaceful, wonderful transition
that produced salutary effects.

11
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:07,197
the myth of the European Union that only brought
money, prosperity and freedom to Spain.

12
00:01:07,198 --> 00:01:14,767
the myth of NATO, portrayed as the great
protector of freedom in the world.

13
00:01:14,768 --> 00:01:18,423
or the myth of the neoliberal speech,

14
00:01:18,424 --> 00:01:26,291
as the central element of an economic
system that has obviously collapsed today.

15
00:01:26,292 --> 00:01:31,206
What I notice from all of this is
that many Spanish citizens

16
00:01:31,207 --> 00:01:35,146
have had the opportunity in the past few months
to start questioning those mythes.

17
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:46,212
In spring 2011, five or six major elements
were joined together in an almost magical way.

18
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:53,449
The first, obviously, is the crisis. A second element,
the protests generated by the crisis in the universities.

19
00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:04,012
Third, the precise agenda of May 2011 with
some dull provincial and mayoral elections.

20
00:02:04,013 --> 00:02:10,347
Forth, the symbol of the Arab spring,
which I believe is more important that it seems.

21
00:02:10,348 --> 00:02:16,077
Fifth and last element is the background work
done by the alternative social movements.

22
00:02:16,078 --> 00:02:19,979
Without this work the 15M movement
is literally unexplainable.

23
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:27,544
unexplainable even if I agree that this work alone
is not enough to explain a much more complex movement.

24
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:35,751
I believe it's the junction of these five elements that explain
the appearance, that I must confess surprised many of us,

25
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:43,932
of an extremely vital movement. A movement that was distinguished,
in one of its essential dimensions, by the absence of any label.

26
00:02:43,933 --> 00:02:50,461
People that militated here, could also militate
in parties, unions or other social movements,

27
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,544
but they had decided that there
weren't going to be any labels here.

28
00:02:53,545 --> 00:02:59,913
The scenario became much more
complex starting from June 2011.

29
00:02:59,914 --> 00:03:04,873
When the movement decided to dismantle
most of the campings in the occupied places,

30
00:03:04,874 --> 00:03:11,138
and turned to a form of popular assemblies
in the neighborhoods, cities, villages.

31
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:21,764
The dimension of "relegated" young people
that caracterized this movement's first steps, was over,

32
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:29,714
in exchange for a much more complex scenario
both in a generational and in a social perspective.

33
00:03:29,715 --> 00:03:35,297
It seems to me that this form of action,
more humble, less attractive for the medias,

34
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,607
makes the popular assemblies
even more interesting.

35
00:03:41,232 --> 00:03:45,524
Polls show that the movement
hasn't lost people's support.

36
00:03:45,525 --> 00:03:51,874
This is very interesting because I think that the movement
has become more radical during the past year.

37
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:58,354
Generally a radicalized movement usually looses
its popular backup. But it was not the case.

38
00:03:58,355 --> 00:04:03,198
This movement is clearly
more radical today but

39
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:09,199
probably because of the crisis and the budget cuts,
the population is still supporting it.
