1
00:00:01,502 --> 00:00:02,924
Neighbors !

2
00:00:02,925 --> 00:00:04,923
Listen !

3
00:00:04,924 --> 00:00:07,135
We are at war !

4
00:00:07,136 --> 00:00:09,552
And we will keep fighting !

5
00:00:09,553 --> 00:00:12,518
So that nobody will be homeless !

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:14,296
That's what the Constitution says :

7
00:00:14,297 --> 00:00:17,943
everybody should have a home !

8
00:00:18,827 --> 00:00:22,212
So come here and sign ! Sign ! 

9
00:00:22,813 --> 00:00:23,813
Sign !

10
00:00:28,117 --> 00:00:31,215
We've been here for a month.

11
00:00:31,016 --> 00:00:37,485
All this was organized because we had a lot of colleagues
who have seen their homes taken away from them.

12
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:42,154
we decided to come here,
in the center of Madrid,

13
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:50,503
because all the banks are here.

14
00:00:50,504 --> 00:00:55,333
It worked very well because
more and more people are coming.

15
00:00:55,334 --> 00:01:00,335
It was the only thing we could do.

16
00:01:00,336 --> 00:01:08,245
This is our struggle against the banks,
we try to stop our colleagues from being evicted,

17
00:01:08,246 --> 00:01:11,666
and we continue so that they don't have
their homes taken away from them. 

18
00:01:12,067 --> 00:01:15,292
Don't let them fool you, they are lying !

19
00:01:15,293 --> 00:01:17,470
The bank is lying !

20
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:21,280
What they want is to
keep earning more millions !

21
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:25,336
Come on and sign !
They're taking away their apartments !

22
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:28,476
They're throwing them on the street !
Come on and sign !

23
00:01:28,477 --> 00:01:34,177
Madame, sign, that doesn't cost you anything
and you'll be doing a great thing.

24
00:01:35,278 --> 00:01:42,801
Because every little bit helps.

25
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:43,802
Come on and sign !

26
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:46,410
My son in law and my daughter
are both unemployed.

27
00:01:46,411 --> 00:01:52,185
they have 680 euros
a month of unemployment,

28
00:01:52,586 --> 00:01:56,120
but they have to pay
700 euros of mortgage.

29
00:01:56,121 --> 00:02:01,332
So they came to live with me
because they have no other choice.

30
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,930
But the problem is that,

31
00:02:02,931 --> 00:02:04,476
if they don't pay the mortgage,

32
00:02:04,477 --> 00:02:10,043
we stood security for their loan,
my son in law's parents and us,

33
00:02:11,144 --> 00:02:16,246
and if the bank doesn't get the money,
they will take our apartment,

34
00:02:16,247 --> 00:02:20,766
and if it's not enough
they will take another apartment,

35
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,274
until it covers for the debt.

36
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:27,327
And if it's still not enough,
the debt continues.

37
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:32,093
It is a social injustice.

38
00:02:32,094 --> 00:02:34,213
Not because I say so,

39
00:02:34,214 --> 00:02:39,499
but because the European Commission said so too,
and the Spanish judges said so,

40
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,846
the lawyers and the police...

41
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:46,978
People now are starting to realize
the truth about this problem. 

42
00:03:02,033 --> 00:03:05,131
A woman just killed herself !

43
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:09,665
And that is the government's fault !

44
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,810
Let them hear that in France, in Germany,
let them hear it everywhere !

45
00:03:13,811 --> 00:03:16,891
But they are murdering people
because of the fucking banks !

46
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:19,504
We won't forget, we won't forgive.

47
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:25,721
They are murdering people,
there are 200 deaths so far this year !

48
00:03:26,422 --> 00:03:27,605
Do you hear me ?

49
00:03:28,106 --> 00:03:31,855
All of Spain must know that !

50
00:03:32,456 --> 00:03:35,672
That they're committing murder
to save the banks ! 

51
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:40,855
You know that sooner or later
they will throw you out of your house,

52
00:03:41,656 --> 00:03:45,062
you're waiting for that moment
when they'll ring the doorbell,

53
00:03:45,063 --> 00:03:46,563
showing you the papers,

54
00:03:46,964 --> 00:03:51,251
telling you "in 10 days from now
you will leave this house".

55
00:03:51,252 --> 00:03:54,599
So psychologically, you keep thinking
about this over and over.

56
00:03:54,600 --> 00:04:00,935
People end up in depression,

57
00:04:00,936 --> 00:04:06,892
they don't always end up killing themselves
but this is a serious psychological problem,

58
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:12,866
aspecially for those who have children,
and so it becomes an important social problem. 

59
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:24,941
"530 property evictions a day
10 suicides a day"

60
00:04:24,942 --> 00:04:31,568
"I lost my home and my job,
but I didn't loose my dignity."

61
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:37,854
"What future for our children
if our only legacy for them is misery ?"

62
00:04:39,255 --> 00:04:41,303
In every job people take
 cigarette breaks, right ?

63
00:04:42,285 --> 00:04:44,168
This is my smoke.

64
00:04:57,067 --> 00:05:00,979
A signature !
Because no one should be homeless !
