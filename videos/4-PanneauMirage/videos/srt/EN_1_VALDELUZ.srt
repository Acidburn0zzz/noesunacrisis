1
00:00:04,047 --> 00:00:10,049
Around the Guadalajará high-speed train station,
is born Valdeluz !

2
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:22,414
Linked to the transport and communication route
on which Europe's development is based,

3
00:00:22,415 --> 00:00:24,718
At a high connectivity point,

4
00:00:26,313 --> 00:00:28,995
A city designed for the 21st century,

5
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,063
with all modern services,

6
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:37,564
and with all infrastructures required for the future.

7
00:00:40,633 --> 00:00:42,270
Prepared for growing.

8
00:00:43,757 --> 00:00:45,760
Thought for living.

9
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:17,560
Every day your illusions colide with our illusions

10
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:45,348
A city for the future,

11
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:54,065
in which we will start living very soon.

12
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:00,939
Ciudad Valdeluz !

13
00:04:01,411 --> 00:04:03,373
Start living !

14
00:04:10,188 --> 00:04:13,020
Ciudad Valdeluz is not a city.

15
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:23,315
Originally built for 30.000 people, only a few
hundred families live in Ciudad Valdeluz

16
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:32,876
The promotor of the city, Reyal Urbis,
filed for bankruptcy in February 2013.

17
00:04:33,177 --> 00:04:40,798
Ciudad Valdeluz has no public services.

18
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:48,251
A single bus line connects Ciudad Valdeluz
with Guadalajará, the closest city.

19
00:04:48,852 --> 00:04:56,600
The golf, which is not used, is however maintened
with water from the neighboring river.

20
00:05:00,996 --> 00:05:07,204
Every evening, the empty buildings are light up
to give an illusion of life.

21
00:05:11,237 --> 00:05:15,472
Ciudad Valdeluz is not a city.

22
00:05:15,473 --> 00:05:22,086
Ciudad Valdeluz is an illusion.
