1
00:00:04,956 --> 00:00:07,993
The causes of the current economic situation
are the following ones.

2
00:00:07,894 --> 00:00:10,194
First a very high public deficit.

3
00:00:10,773 --> 00:00:14,594
Second, the lack of competitiveness
of the Spanish economy,

4
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:18,295
which forces us to apply structural reforms.

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:22,596
Third, a very indebted financial system.

6
00:00:26,157 --> 00:00:29,465
It is one of todays news :
the European markets are collapsing,

7
00:00:29,466 --> 00:00:32,666
and among them the IBEX
which had a fall of almost 6%.

8
00:00:32,767 --> 00:00:35,767
Spain asked the Euro-group
for a rescue fund for the banks.

9
00:00:35,768 --> 00:00:38,768
Euro-group allowed a 100 billion euros loan.

10
00:00:42,065 --> 00:00:46,961
100 billion euros. That is the maximum amount
that Europe is willing to lend to Spain

11
00:00:46,962 --> 00:00:49,460
in order to save its bank sector.

12
00:00:49,461 --> 00:00:52,278
After Greece, Ireland and Portugal,

13
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:56,104
it is the turn of the forth economy
of the euro zone to call for help.

14
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:03,392
Hundreds of indignants protested this Saturday
in front of the Bankia head office in Madrid,

15
00:01:03,693 --> 00:01:07,493
under the slogan
"save the people, evict the bankers"

16
00:01:33,485 --> 00:01:37,569
Capitalism is like a bicycle,
you have to keep pedaling

17
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,970
because if you stop, you'll fall.
Capitalism needs to grow in order to survive.

18
00:01:41,971 --> 00:01:48,471
For 10, 15 years, capitalism had
a growth formula : the real estate bubble.

19
00:01:48,472 --> 00:01:53,372
Building houses, selling houses, speculating. 

20
00:01:53,373 --> 00:01:59,773
We hear saying that the capitalist model
in the EU has a more productive nature

21
00:01:59,774 --> 00:02:05,274
than the American one who is more speculative...

22
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:09,775
In Spain that idea should 
have shocked us

23
00:02:09,776 --> 00:02:13,968
because the basics of
the Spanish economic growth,

24
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:21,277
in the '90 and in the first decade of the 21st century,
were tourism and construction,

25
00:02:21,278 --> 00:02:27,778
two economic sectors that are defined
by their speculative condition.

26
00:02:27,779 --> 00:02:33,044
in 2007, the real estate
construction in Spain

27
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:40,790
has been equal to the total of buildings
made in France, Germany and England.

28
00:02:40,791 --> 00:02:47,457
you put together all that has been built in these three countries,
you will get to the same quantity as in Spain.

29
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,181
There is clearly something wrong here.

30
00:02:50,382 --> 00:02:54,627
The houses, the apartments
have become a financial tool.

31
00:02:55,128 --> 00:03:02,238
Aspecially that the banks, as it happened
in the USA with the subprimes,

32
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:08,039
made no checking of the people
they lent money to for buying a house,

33
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,367
because if those people couldn't pay, the house was worthed three times
more two years after, so the bank wasn't loosing anything.

34
00:03:14,368 --> 00:03:20,941
Everybody is in real estate, real estate collapses :
well, everything collapses ! It's as simple as that !

35
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:23,763
So it was not a miracle at all.
It was only an illusion.

36
00:03:26,649 --> 00:03:31,783
"Trusting"

37
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:40,821
"Economic terrorism...Market dictatorship...
Politicians, puppets of the market."

38
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:47,300
"Death to the money !"

39
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:57,101
When the crisis exploded, 50% of the money
circulating in Spain was handled by the savings banks.

40
00:03:57,302 --> 00:04:05,943
And the savings banks were manipulated by the politicians,
no matter the political party, left wing or right wing.

41
00:04:05,944 --> 00:04:16,958
They were using savings banks to make investments
in infrastructures that made them look as the best.

42
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,020
They built an airport but there was
no need for an airport ! It's really crazy !

43
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:25,823
For example the airport of Ciudad Real,
next to Madrid, not far from here.

44
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:29,298
Madrid already has an airport.
Why another airport so close ?

45
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:31,199
I would understand it if it were
500 km away or 300 km...

46
00:04:31,213 --> 00:04:35,800
A phantom airport ready to receive
2,5 millions of travelers a year,

47
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:38,169
that today a place of
transit for hares only.

48
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:42,354
It costed 1 billion euros,
today it is sold for 100 millions,

49
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:44,096
A tenth of what it was worthed.

50
00:04:44,097 --> 00:04:49,365
Spain with 47 million inhabitants
has 52 airports.

51
00:04:49,366 --> 00:04:53,514
Germany with almost twice as
many inhabitants, has only 39. 

52
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:58,042
The first phase of the crisis was
when they started saying

53
00:04:58,043 --> 00:05:02,886
that the problem was only related to the
savings banks not the private banks.

54
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:10,891
And we can prove that because they invested in useless airports,
useless train stations, buildings, things like that, ok, fine.

55
00:05:10,892 --> 00:05:13,481
So what we have to do is make them merge.

56
00:05:13,482 --> 00:05:21,509
As the savings banks can't take money
from the financial markets, the trade markets,

57
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:28,039
They said "if we convert them into anonymous
companies, into banks, it's going to be great !

58
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:34,579
Because we'll have our capital
raised by giving stocks to the public."

59
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:41,802
When Bankia was released on the market, it was really
the huge stock operation, the great example of stock exchange release.

60
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:48,201
So they convinced a whole bunch of clients
to buy Bankia's stocks. All right ?

61
00:05:48,702 --> 00:05:53,763
Those clients, today, they have lost
90% of their investment.

62
00:05:53,764 --> 00:05:58,718
We are now proving that the accounts
Bankia presented were wrong.

63
00:05:58,719 --> 00:06:02,894
So the Spanish security exchange commission
didn't do its job.

64
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:08,718
Because its mission is to verify that
the showed data is correct. And it wasn't.

65
00:06:08,719 --> 00:06:16,048
A lot of things were hidden and this had been presented
as the big restart example of the Spanish bank industry. 

66
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:25,480
Bankia has a debt of over 19 billion euros.

67
00:06:25,481 --> 00:06:29,281
An unprecedented loss that the company
explains by having to spend 27 billion euros

68
00:06:29,282 --> 00:06:33,182
to cover for the real estate risk.

69
00:06:33,183 --> 00:06:37,110
The new president of the Spanish group
Bankia shows his confidence.

70
00:06:37,111 --> 00:06:41,450
Friday he asked the Spanish Government
for a record support of 19 billion euros.

71
00:06:41,451 --> 00:06:45,066
Without that, the forth bank in the country,
falling under the toxic real estate assets,

72
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:51,336
would risk to contaminate the whole sector.
This public bank rescue costed 23,5 billion euros.

73
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:56,914
In Spain today, government's speech
notifies that the main problem of the economy

74
00:06:56,915 --> 00:07:00,744
is the public debt,
the debt of different public services.

75
00:07:00,745 --> 00:07:04,680
But 83% of the Spanish debt is private :

76
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:09,346
a debt contracted mainly by
the banks and the savings banks.

77
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:14,368
And the masterstroke here,
what I believe to be a genuine scam,

78
00:07:14,369 --> 00:07:19,316
is the process of nationalization of the private debt
now going into full public ownership.

79
00:07:19,317 --> 00:07:22,353
The banks, the financial institutions,
that have engaged

80
00:07:22,354 --> 00:07:27,021
strictly speculative and
deeply immoral activities,

81
00:07:27,022 --> 00:07:32,209
are now receiving public funds in which,
let's not forget, the EU is completely involved. 

82
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:38,501
As for the private banks, the managers
weren't able to manage them,

83
00:07:38,502 --> 00:07:42,583
That's a proved thing since they needed help,
I think I'm making myself clear.

84
00:07:42,584 --> 00:07:45,907
Clearly, no evidence is needed,
it's just like that.

85
00:07:45,908 --> 00:07:49,906
They're getting help, but the families
who were scammed,

86
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:53,419
and who don't have any means now,
they are thrown out in the street ?

87
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:58,118
That makes you want to explode !
That's not fair !

88
00:07:58,153 --> 00:08:04,294
700 000 to a million people have seen
several billions of their savings evaporate.

89
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:08,694
32 billions in 2010,
in a complex financial product :

90
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:13,278
the "preferred shares",
which were never made comprehensive,


91
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:16,964
that the banks started to offer
during the economic boom.

92
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:20,451
When the real estate bubble bursted,

93
00:08:20,452 --> 00:08:24,598
those shares were a fast way
for the banks to replenish their treasury

94
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,906
cumulate the reserves requested
by the Government and by Brussels.

95
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:34,064
The scammed clients were the old,
retired people,

96
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:39,276
that trusted the recommendations of their bank agencies
regarding the placement of their entire life savings.

97
00:08:39,777 --> 00:08:42,996
Today, 300 complaints 
have been filed by people

98
00:08:42,997 --> 00:08:46,831
invested their savings into "preferred shares"
offered in 2009 by Bankia.

99
00:08:46,832 --> 00:08:51,112
They claim their money back and
the public recognition of the scam. 

100
00:08:51,313 --> 00:08:54,182
It's the same policy as in Greece,

101
00:08:54,183 --> 00:08:58,959
a policy that leads to economic
and social suicide.

102
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,740
A policy dictated by the Troïka.

103
00:09:02,741 --> 00:09:07,370
the only thing the Troïka wants
is to save French and German banks.

104
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:14,419
The Spanish financial system has
a debt of 300 billion dollars

105
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,820
to the French and German banks.

106
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:22,020
If the Spanish financial system falls down,

107
00:09:22,021 --> 00:09:24,228
that debt will never be paid.

108
00:09:24,229 --> 00:09:27,994
So what the Troïka wants
is for this debt to be paid

109
00:09:27,995 --> 00:09:29,991
in order to avoid 
a domino effect.

110
00:09:29,992 --> 00:09:33,867
Its goal is simply to give money
to the Spanish financial system,

111
00:09:33,868 --> 00:09:39,237
so that the Spanish financial system
pays its debts to the French and German banks.

112
00:09:39,238 --> 00:09:42,512
And as a consequence of this priority,

113
00:09:42,513 --> 00:09:45,613
we have budget cuts
in the health sector, in education

114
00:09:45,614 --> 00:09:48,201
and we don't fight against unemployment.
There is no fight at all.

115
00:09:48,302 --> 00:09:52,015
"Murderers"

116
00:09:52,016 --> 00:09:55,413
"Thieves"

117
00:09:59,322 --> 00:10:03,469
"We don't owe,
we don't pay !"

118
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,904
"They are leaving us without a future.
There are people responsible, there are solutions."
