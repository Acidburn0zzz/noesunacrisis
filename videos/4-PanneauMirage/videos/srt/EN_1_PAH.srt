1
00:00:05,476 --> 00:00:09,830
Two suicides in less than 48h,
both in the province of Málaga.

2
00:00:09,831 --> 00:00:13,114
A man and a woman took their life
after loosing their home.

3
00:00:13,215 --> 00:00:15,449
Amaya Egaña was 53 years old

4
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,698
when she threw herself from
the forth floor of her apartment's balcony,

5
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:22,332
just when the court bailiffs
were at the building's front door.

6
00:00:22,333 --> 00:00:25,831
A 40 year old man hanged himself
in his home in Barcelona

7
00:00:25,832 --> 00:00:29,301
after receiving the eviction
order for unpaid rent.

8
00:00:29,302 --> 00:00:31,463
It is the third death case
in less than a month,

9
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:35,355
related to the procedures
for unpaid mortgages. 

10
00:00:38,323 --> 00:00:43,934
This apartment is not 
to be given away !

11
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:52,959
First we have to stop the eviction,
then start the battle against the bank

12
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,506
to get the debt canceled,

13
00:00:54,507 --> 00:00:58,170
so that they don't request the rest of the debt
after having them evicted from their home.

14
00:00:58,171 --> 00:01:04,171
After that, the Social Assistance has to find an alternative accommodation,
where he could stay with his daughter.

15
00:01:04,178 --> 00:01:09,327
Because the bank gave Anuar a mortgage
even though they knew he wouldn't be able to pay for it.

16
00:01:09,328 --> 00:01:12,422
He didn't have a payslip, nor fixed incomes,

17
00:01:12,423 --> 00:01:16,137
and even so, the bank gave him the loan, when
they were only interested in granting mortgages.

18
00:01:16,138 --> 00:01:22,605
They sold him a car without brakes,
they knew he couldn't handle the mortgage. 

19
00:01:22,655 --> 00:01:26,989
This apartment is not 
to be given away !

20
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,521
"Los desahucios", 
the property evictions.

21
00:01:34,522 --> 00:01:38,241
Not a day goes by in Spain
without talking about this issue.

22
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:44,351
It became the symbol of the country's big fall
into poverty and insecurity.

23
00:01:45,705 --> 00:01:51,526
Since 2007 and the beginning of the crisis,
around 500.000 people have been evicted from their homes,

24
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:56,633
for not being able the pay for the loans
they got during the real estate boom.

25
00:01:56,834 --> 00:02:01,256
The banks seize the houses
and the Spaniards end up in the street.

26
00:02:03,704 --> 00:02:08,059
At the PAH, the Platform 
of Mortgage Victims,

27
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,372
a group born as a result of
the 15M meetings in 2011,

28
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:15,133
people fight day and night
against evictions.

29
00:02:16,612 --> 00:02:19,533
Chema Ruiz is one of the
spokespersons of the PAH.

30
00:02:19,568 --> 00:02:26,386
He contributed with his colleagues to the emersion of
a public debate regarding evictions and the Spanish mortgage law.

31
00:02:26,387 --> 00:02:31,569
He doesn't hesitate to organize blocking actions
against evictions or to occupy the banks,

32
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,924
facing a government that turns
a deaf ear to it.

33
00:02:35,176 --> 00:02:40,530
Everyday more and more people come to the platform,
and each time in a more insecure situation.

34
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:47,284
The purchasing power of people with 
mortgage problems is starting to grow.

35
00:02:47,285 --> 00:02:49,944
We're not talking about poor people anymore,
that no one cares about,

36
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:53,701
we're talking about people playing golf

37
00:02:53,702 --> 00:02:59,576
with judges and journalists,
professions that used to have a certain purchasing power.

38
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:04,330
They had signed a mortgage according
to their past living standards,

39
00:03:04,331 --> 00:03:09,026
but now the upper middle class
 is starting to drown. 

40
00:03:09,027 --> 00:03:10,947
Neighbors !
Wake up !

41
00:03:10,948 --> 00:03:13,118
They're evicting people 
right next to you !

42
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:22,585
At the news they say that 
they're reimbursing the banks.

43
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:27,324
 I saw that the government
will give 300 millions to Bankia.

44
00:03:27,325 --> 00:03:28,525
The governement should be 
ashamed of that.

45
00:03:28,526 --> 00:03:33,137
They get the money and they take the homes
from people who need it the most.

46
00:03:33,138 --> 00:03:37,215
That's unacceptable. 
what the government is doing is not fair. 

47
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:38,816
How much debt do you have left ?

48
00:03:39,518 --> 00:03:41,234
196.000.

49
00:03:42,502 --> 00:03:46,446
I had a 205.000 debt,

50
00:03:46,447 --> 00:03:50,778
I payed for it during three years, 
but I mostly payed for the interests.

51
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:53,641
And now I don't know,
now that I'll give them my home,

52
00:03:53,642 --> 00:03:56,982
I'll  stay with the debt...
I don't know what will happen... 

53
00:04:02,548 --> 00:04:06,521
Comrades, let's go downstairs, 
they're here.

54
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:08,822
The bank, already ? 

55
00:04:16,792 --> 00:04:21,662
"Bankia cheats, scams
and leaves people without a home."

56
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:33,338
The problem is that in Spain the banks were allowed
to overestimate housings with no limits.

57
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:37,125
They were signing mortgages
based on a totally false value.

58
00:04:37,126 --> 00:04:42,628
When the value of the housing starts to adjust,
it returns to its fare level.

59
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:46,161
So families who are still able to pay,

60
00:04:46,162 --> 00:04:52,664
signed for a mortgage that was worth 200.000 euros
but because of the interests

61
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:55,914
it sums up to 400, 450.000 euros.

62
00:04:55,915 --> 00:04:59,664
They end up paying 
400, 450 000 euros

63
00:04:59,665 --> 00:05:02,500
for a  property that is really 
worth 70 000 today.

64
00:05:02,801 --> 00:05:09,893
We will now let you 
talk and ask questions.

65
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:15,520
So raise your hand and we will 
pass you the microphone.

66
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:16,938
I have the following problem.

67
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:18,874
I am retired.

68
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,047
My retirement pension 
is of 550 euros.

69
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:25,665
My appartement is now auctioned.
What do I do ? 

70
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:28,744
In fact I think that 
all of us present here

71
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,987
are condemned to loose our homes.

72
00:05:34,226 --> 00:05:35,934
Besides loosing your home,

73
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:39,296
the bank is still asking
 a large debt from you

74
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:44,844
because the housing is awarded for 60% of its value,
a value that they decided,

75
00:05:44,932 --> 00:05:48,081
and they can also ask for
delay interests and legal costs.

76
00:05:48,082 --> 00:05:52,421
We are condemned to never be able
to start over our life.

77
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:57,011
Confronted with this phenomenon,
Chema and the PAH members

78
00:05:57,012 --> 00:06:00,304
plead for the transfer
in lieu of payment solution. 

79
00:06:00,305 --> 00:06:05,685
In fact, it would allow citizens to give their homes
in exchange for a total erase of their debts.

80
00:06:05,686 --> 00:06:09,889
The government and the banks
reject this solution for now.

81
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:13,978
They told me they were 
going to send the...

82
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:15,079
How is that called ?

83
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,880
They were going to send
the eviction order.

84
00:06:20,194 --> 00:06:22,681
Yes but it hasn't arrived yet.

85
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:26,782
What a disgrace.

86
00:06:26,783 --> 00:06:28,583
- That's alright...

87
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:31,595
Two ushers came to my house

88
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:40,216
telling me that I had a month
to leave the house and do all the paperwork.

89
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:42,775
Would you like to ask for 
the transfer in lieu of payment ?

90
00:06:42,776 --> 00:06:45,989
That means, they take the house
and they leave you alone.

91
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,790
- Yes...

92
00:06:47,791 --> 00:06:50,761
- Or do you have another solution ?
Rent another housing?

93
00:06:50,762 --> 00:06:53,362
- No, what I want
 is to keep my house.

94
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,376
- We don't want 
to loose our apartment.

95
00:06:56,377 --> 00:07:00,561
It's been 4 years since he is 
unemployed, we can not pay.

96
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:03,551
I don't want them to evict us...

97
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:05,952
- What about a waiting period ?

98
00:07:05,953 --> 00:07:08,890
-  The bank doesn't want that ! We want...

99
00:07:08,891 --> 00:07:10,816
- What bank ?
- Bankia.

100
00:07:24,558 --> 00:07:27,416
Let's see if we can get you
something in exchange.

101
00:07:27,453 --> 00:07:30,216
If not, you would  loose your home
and stay with 100.000 euros of debt.

102
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:32,438
They say here you have 
80 000 left to pay.

103
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:35,546
Plus 40 000 of taxes. 
That's 120.000 of debt.

104
00:07:35,547 --> 00:07:37,755
We will see if we manage to negotiate.

105
00:07:37,756 --> 00:07:41,914
If not, what you have 
to do is talk to...

106
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:43,157
Where do you live ?

107
00:07:43,158 --> 00:07:44,158
- La Elipa.

108
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:47,896
- Okay, in La Elipa there's a neighborhood assembly,
a group of indignants and everything.

109
00:07:47,914 --> 00:07:51,715
If they don't cancel your debt,
you should see with those groups,

110
00:07:51,716 --> 00:07:55,756
and give them your home, so that
someone else can occupy and live in it. 

111
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:04,623
Besides meeting people
in the same situation as you,

112
00:08:05,424 --> 00:08:11,022
It's very very important that you go
to the neighborhood assemblies.

113
00:08:11,023 --> 00:08:15,664
There you will find people that will be there
the day of your eviction,

114
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:20,405
People that, if you want to protest
in front of your bank, they will go with you.

115
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:25,540
So if you think that your lawyer
will save you, you are wrong.

116
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:28,917
You have to mobilize yourself !
Okay ?

117
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,209
-  And together we are stronger !

118
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,712
- Let's go on with the questions...

119
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:39,389
When things are unbearable, 
there are only two ways :

120
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:43,202
either we kill each other

121
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:45,895
over the miserable scraps left,

122
00:08:47,499 --> 00:08:49,404
and I don't think it will be that way.

123
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:54,582
either, and I believe that, we will manage

124
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:58,543
to organize a European alternative
and change things.

125
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:05,455
The Europe of markets will become
the Europe of the People,

126
00:09:05,492 --> 00:09:07,363
I am sure of that.

127
00:09:07,364 --> 00:09:17,282
We don't allow 
any more evictions ! 

128
00:09:17,283 --> 00:09:19,857
...an information from the City Police,

129
00:09:19,858 --> 00:09:23,638
to communicate to the national police officials,

130
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:27,898
that, apparently, and we will 
confirm that in a few moments,

131
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:33,977
the judge has canceled Anuar 
and his family's eviction today.

132
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:47,078
YES WE CAN !

133
00:09:50,309 --> 00:09:58,470
The PAH (Platform of Mortgage Victims) received in 2013
the European Citizen Price, awarded by the European Parliament.

134
00:09:58,871 --> 00:10:07,829
The members of the Popular Party have immediately denounced this decision,
accusing it of being "outrageous" and asked the Parliament to redraw it.

135
00:10:08,611 --> 00:10:12,484
The property evictions are continuing.

136
00:10:12,485 --> 00:10:16,918
One eviction every 15 minutes.
