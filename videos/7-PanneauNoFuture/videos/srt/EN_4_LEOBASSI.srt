1
00:00:02,781 --> 00:00:08,596
My name is Leo Bassi. I come from an old circus family
and I am very proud of that.

2
00:00:08,897 --> 00:00:13,302
I have many nationalities
as all the circus people.

3
00:00:13,303 --> 00:00:16,835
I am proud to be 60 years old,

4
00:00:16,836 --> 00:00:22,810
and still be able to laugh
about everything, as I am a clown.

5
00:00:25,379 --> 00:00:28,108
In fifteen years, I've worked 
ten seasons in this theater...

6
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,795
And this is my special meditation
corner before the show.

7
00:00:35,075 --> 00:00:41,712
I actually love the fact that this theater
presents many other shows.

8
00:00:41,713 --> 00:00:46,734
Some days it accomodates four shows
one after another, in the afternoon,

9
00:00:46,735 --> 00:00:53,865
in the evening, then in the second evening
and sometimes late at midnight, for special events.

10
00:00:55,637 --> 00:01:00,738
There are sets stored everywhere, there isn't 
enough space for the dressing room,

11
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:07,621
but still making the effort to stay
independent, refusing any grants.

12
00:01:07,622 --> 00:01:16,867
And satisfy the public's need for a completely
independent space of artistic creation.

13
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:20,470
I find that extremely 
courageous nowadays.

14
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:27,691
Yes, the conditions are precarious, the theater
is close to being dirty but it's for a good reason.

15
00:01:27,692 --> 00:01:36,456
I would rather be in a theater with dirty,
precarious dressing rooms but that takes risks,

16
00:01:39,169 --> 00:01:43,761
than in another theatre with beautiful dressing rooms,
where everything is perfect but where in reality,

17
00:01:43,762 --> 00:01:48,960
it's only a commercial operation
to make the public come and pay,

18
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:54,576
and what happens on stage, and the meaning
of the work are secondary.

19
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,923
Oh, five minutes left...

20
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:10,052
I am an agitator
and a happy clown.

21
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:17,748
Because it's been fourty years...
Fourty years !

22
00:02:18,813 --> 00:02:22,736
that I try to fuck the
power in my shows.

23
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:29,399
No matter the power !
Political, spiritual, economic.

24
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:33,902
It's like a deep 
need inside of me.

25
00:02:35,476 --> 00:02:38,120
And I am happy at this moment,

26
00:02:38,121 --> 00:02:43,219
because I noticed that something
was happening in society.

27
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:49,936
I sensed a true lack
of respect of the people,

28
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:53,406
towards the institutions.

29
00:02:53,407 --> 00:02:57,601
Bankers, politicians,
even religious people  :

30
00:02:57,602 --> 00:03:01,469
they are no longer 
respected at all.

31
00:03:03,284 --> 00:03:06,513
And that makes me happy !

32
00:03:07,731 --> 00:03:15,138
When I was 16, 17, I was lucky 
enough to be in Paris in May 68.

33
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:20,315
And the months after that,
 the spring...

34
00:03:21,873 --> 00:03:25,854
My teenage memories from that time,

35
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:32,231
are very much a reflection of what a lot of people
here in Spain are living today.

36
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:38,677
That same electric feeling that
something new is about to be created,

37
00:03:38,678 --> 00:03:44,833
that feeling that we don't need
to learn from the past anymore.

38
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:52,431
By learning I am talking about the references
we have regarding the rules of living, well all that has fallen.

39
00:03:52,432 --> 00:03:57,964
And so there's a great liberty,
the feeling that we're creating a new world !

40
00:03:58,312 --> 00:04:00,487
To be clear,

41
00:04:00,488 --> 00:04:03,460
anything can happen tonight.

42
00:04:03,961 --> 00:04:06,980
Even a violent reaction
against the public.

43
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:10,266
But just to keep things clear,
as I told you,

44
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:13,536
no matter what I do,
I only do it with love.

45
00:04:14,785 --> 00:04:16,877
I deeply love you !

46
00:04:16,878 --> 00:04:18,798
I'm not doing it 
to be aggressive,

47
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,290
I only want to give
you some adrenaline.

48
00:04:23,255 --> 00:04:27,945
I know I find myself in a time of great transition,
and that's such a pleasure !

49
00:04:27,946 --> 00:04:33,961
It's extremely rewarding to live at a time
where everything is insecure,

50
00:04:33,962 --> 00:04:38,270
where many great 
conversations are being...

51
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:44,167
... of being able to assist to those great conversations
that will define the next century.

52
00:04:44,168 --> 00:04:48,489
All this is good. And we can
feel the energy in the streets.

53
00:04:50,504 --> 00:04:52,479
Oh, so many memories...

54
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,907
Do you know what
 happened in here ?

55
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:59,484
In 2006, the 1st of March,
and I didn't invent that,

56
00:04:59,485 --> 00:05:03,227
right here, five meters 
away, someone,

57
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:07,523
or some people, because the police
is still looking for the portraitures,

58
00:05:07,524 --> 00:05:11,934
someone put a kilo
of explosive with gasoline,

59
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:16,934
trying to burn down the
whole theater, and to kill me,

60
00:05:16,935 --> 00:05:21,102
and to kill a lot of people at the same time.
This is not a joke.

61
00:05:21,119 --> 00:05:25,337
It happened during the show "The revelation",
where I was talking about my atheism,

62
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:28,427
and some people in Spain
didn't like that.

63
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:33,713
I have been to many meetings, I have listened a lot,
I have participated and I have spoken also.

64
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,309
And in my opinion, the level
of discussions was high.

65
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:43,920
I had the feeling that what was
 being said were not ordinary.

66
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:48,815
Everybody was sitting at Puerta del Sol
but talking about fundamental things !

67
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:55,916
A place which, only a few weeks earlier,
was full of L'Oreal publicities,

68
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:07,718
of hamburgers and a few tourists shops
selling fans with bulls on it,

69
00:06:07,719 --> 00:06:11,442
that was Puerta del Sol 
for many years !

70
00:06:11,443 --> 00:06:15,387
And I was an old man there,
they were all 25, 30 years old.

71
00:06:15,388 --> 00:06:23,776
And I believe they were listening to me
a little bit like Indians in the Indian movies,

72
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:29,474
there's the ancient wise men council, the young people come
with the ideas and the old ones are just behind them.

73
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:37,201
So I played this part of the wise man,
searching and questioning their system.

74
00:06:37,202 --> 00:06:44,766
How can we accuse the 15M movement
of not having a bigger success,

75
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:49,072
when the rest of the society
is even worst ?

76
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:53,093
I have always tried to open
consciousness about political issues.

77
00:06:53,494 --> 00:06:59,168
For example many years ago, I started my own war
against the multinational corporations.

78
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:06,937
The idea that a multinational can fire you,
destroy the middle class.

79
00:07:08,777 --> 00:07:13,295
And the difficulty is to make people
understand this political concept,

80
00:07:13,296 --> 00:07:16,174
this rational concept
but in a sensual way.

81
00:07:17,494 --> 00:07:20,292
How can I scare people
with a multinational ?

82
00:07:22,792 --> 00:07:26,482
How to make people feel

83
00:07:26,483 --> 00:07:30,069
this threat inside them ?

84
00:08:45,331 --> 00:08:50,774
There is an opposition against Merkel today,
so you'll find posters of Merkel dressed up like Hitler.

85
00:08:50,809 --> 00:08:54,699
All this is nothing else but a sign
of something much deeper :

86
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,574
what does being Mediterranean mean ?

87
00:08:57,575 --> 00:09:02,359
The fact that this Mediterranean world,
and the Italian world that I know perfectly,

88
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,814
believes to be basically superior
to the North, because we are so called,

89
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:16,360
more sensual, more in close contact, with a more sensual
intelligence and education, or at least we think so.

90
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:24,516
But the Mediterranean world cannot 
enter the North way of living.

91
00:09:24,517 --> 00:09:31,836
So the question is : is the euro sustainable
if it represents two entirely different cultures ?

92
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:41,025
Can Europe exist if Bruxelles represents two opposite cultures
that have been enemies for centuries, for thousands of years ?

93
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:45,534
All this is being decided now,
here in the streets.

94
00:09:45,535 --> 00:09:51,979
We know that somehow being
Mediterranean means human contact,

95
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:56,920
being together, sitting and talking
over coffee, that's very Mediterranean.

96
00:09:56,921 --> 00:10:01,365
Working in a factory and not talking
to your colleague, doing this all day long,

97
00:10:01,366 --> 00:10:06,516
that was in the industrial civilization,
that wasn't Mediterranean.

98
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:15,783
This is on my mind 24/7 :
what's the difference, how can this Mediterranean world

99
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:21,779
enter into a new technological society
that's discovering itself ?

100
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:27,708
Just to tell you that we are here !
All together, OK ?
