1
00:00:01,518 --> 00:00:05,186
21 Calle del Pez, 
in the center of Madrid.

2
00:00:05,187 --> 00:00:10,758
This is where the Patio Maravillas is.
Literally : the Court of Miracles.

3
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:16,991
Since the 15th of May 2011 this building has become
a meeting point for the indignant nebula,

4
00:00:16,992 --> 00:00:19,936
and one of the largest 
squats of the capital.

5
00:00:20,866 --> 00:00:26,627
Valentin, a young 21 years old French is one of the
founders of the "Juventud sin Futuro" group,

6
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:33,039
"Youth with no future".
A group that participated actively to the 15M movement.

7
00:00:33,963 --> 00:00:38,082
We truly became a public platform
at the begining of 2011.

8
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:41,724
And we did our first demonstration
on April 7, 2011.

9
00:00:41,725 --> 00:00:48,725
To us, that was truly the moment
Juventud sin Futuro was born.

10
00:00:48,726 --> 00:00:52,698
Being born in the street
it's what mattered most to us.

11
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:58,732
When we called for this demonstration, we were
40 maybe 50 people in Juventud sin Futuro.

12
00:00:58,733 --> 00:01:03,228
And by the end of the demonstration
we were 7.000 people,

13
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:09,275
which might seem even ridiculous today
regarding the protests Spain has seen lately.

14
00:01:09,276 --> 00:01:15,601
But you must know that the protest and mobilization
landscape in Spain was completely deserted.

15
00:01:15,602 --> 00:01:19,106
Which means that a 2.000 people demonstration
was a successful one at that time.

16
00:01:19,107 --> 00:01:26,078
From that point, JSF became a reference
to a movement that was being built. 

17
00:01:31,085 --> 00:01:35,466
This protest was organized by different groups
of students and people in a precarious situation.

18
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:41,622
We called people through social networks,
through Facebook, through Twitter.

19
00:01:41,623 --> 00:01:45,554
We got an answer to it
and the answer is this protest.

20
00:01:45,555 --> 00:01:50,538
We have to use the potential of these networks,
just as it was shown in other countries.

21
00:01:52,365 --> 00:01:54,817
Our first slogan was

22
00:01:54,818 --> 00:02:04,517
"A youth without a house, without a job,
without a pension, without a future but a youth with no fear ".

23
00:02:04,518 --> 00:02:15,835
That was mainly the idea we were trying to bring,
that the situation for the youth was, and keeps being disastrous,

24
00:02:15,836 --> 00:02:22,163
we have very few rights, very few possibilities,
which means we have no future.

25
00:02:22,164 --> 00:02:28,775
But we wanted to show something
positive for the future,

26
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:35,323
that's why we said "with no fear". We're not afraid
and we will fight to make things change.

27
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,108
Juventud Sin Futuro takes actively 
part in the 15M mobilizations.

28
00:02:40,109 --> 00:02:44,682
But the group also tries to defend
Spanish youth's rights,

29
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:48,890
more and more insecure
aspecially in the work sector.

30
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:59,284
This is precisely the "Oficina Precaria's" goal,
an alternative to the traditional unions, created by JSF.

31
00:02:59,319 --> 00:03:03,586
We could file a complaint saying that
you are an intern, but you are actually working,

32
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:08,732
saying they forced you to register at the university
while you are actually doing real work.

33
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:17,694
- If we file that complaint, in the best case scenario,
can we make them recognize my work retrospectively ?

34
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:22,051
- Exactly. Retrospectively, it means you should
receive the salaries they haven't paid you,

35
00:03:22,052 --> 00:03:26,928
based on the minimum interprofessional wage,
or conventionnal wage.

36
00:03:26,929 --> 00:03:32,866
for the past year, because you have
one year to claim unpayed salaries.

37
00:03:36,403 --> 00:03:42,321
We'll stay in contact with you and we'll include
your case into a larger campaign,

38
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:51,858
where we'll regroup other cases like yours
in order to have better chances to pressure them.

39
00:03:51,859 --> 00:03:55,747
What we want is to avoid others
from being in this situation,

40
00:03:55,748 --> 00:04:00,319
because it is a form of violation
of the Spanish labour rights.

41
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:04,908
The minimum wage is 
a little above 400 euros.

42
00:04:04,909 --> 00:04:11,379
Most of the young people that find a job do less hours,
they obviously don't do 8h/day.

43
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:21,756
There are a lot of part-time contracts
where they get 300, 200 euros,

44
00:04:21,757 --> 00:04:25,807
which is not enough to pay your rent,
your life, your college.

45
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:33,618
My mother still supports me,
by giving me 200, 250 euros a month.

46
00:04:36,657 --> 00:04:46,221
Aside from that I work, I do French tutoring
that I obviously don't declare.

47
00:04:46,222 --> 00:04:54,812
That's another reality in Spain. There are a lot
of jobs like this, totally insecure,

48
00:04:54,813 --> 00:05:00,196
that are undeclared.

49
00:05:00,197 --> 00:05:04,294
That doesn't even mean they forget about your rights.
No, it means, you don't have any rights.

50
00:05:04,295 --> 00:05:08,374
You don't have any rights, you don't pay taxes,
so forget about retirement pension.

51
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:12,764
Maybe some people still think
they will get a retirement pension in ten years...

52
00:05:12,765 --> 00:05:19,050
Well... I work undeclared by doing French tutoring,
by doing whatever I find here and there,

53
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:24,529
and maybe I add 100, 150 euros to my
monthly budget, something like that.

54
00:05:25,416 --> 00:05:34,602
Do the math, that makes 350, 400 euros a month,
and with all this I cannot live and pay for a home,

55
00:05:34,603 --> 00:05:39,430
as a result it's been a year since
I've decided to occupy.

56
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:43,300
Moving into empty buildings.
Occupying.

57
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:46,716
This is a common 
practice today in Spain,

58
00:05:46,717 --> 00:05:50,042
in a country where there are
thousands of abandoned buildings.

59
00:05:50,043 --> 00:05:54,280
For many young people or entire families 
evicted from their homes,

60
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:57,302
this is a last chance solution.

61
00:05:57,303 --> 00:06:05,367
"Freeing the space", according to the Spanish expression, 
is also a new way of bonding and redefining solidarity.

62
00:06:05,368 --> 00:06:13,835
I don't think the solution is going up in the mountains
to raise goats with two coats and one pair of boots.

63
00:06:13,836 --> 00:06:22,169
But I do think the true solution
is sharing everything we can have,

64
00:06:22,170 --> 00:06:29,015
everything we own, everything we create,
everything we know.

65
00:06:29,016 --> 00:06:36,399
That means creating common goods in a place
where the State doesn't do anything.

66
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,756
- Would you call yourself optimistic about the future ?
- It's pretty hard to answer.... I think it depends on the moment.

67
00:06:43,782 --> 00:06:52,912
Sometimes I am filled with optimism,
and sometimes I feel as if I were touching the bottom.

68
00:06:52,913 --> 00:07:00,257
I think it would be very difficult now
to destroy what the 15M has managed to do.

69
00:07:00,258 --> 00:07:07,459
To kill 15M 's victories, because I think that...
the political elites have tried to suffocate the 15M.

70
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:12,754
I think that's not possible anymore because
people are already following that movement,

71
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:15,982
they are determined and
they will now seek solutions.

72
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:21,917
And if the institutional way doesn't give any solution,
they will create their own.
