1
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,033
"Football is so unfair !"

2
00:00:20,034 --> 00:00:23,559
"And this is one of the
unfairest game I have ever seen..."

3
00:00:25,026 --> 00:00:35,143
The role of football in Spain, and I'm not talking
about sports in general, is crucial.

4
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:40,892
In France, and not even in Italy, could you imagine
the importance of football in Spain.

5
00:00:44,939 --> 00:00:50,307
SPAIN IS THE WORLD CHAMPION !!!!

6
00:00:50,308 --> 00:00:58,392
My name is Javier Gómez, I am the host of a daily
sports program in Spain, on the Sexta TV channel.

7
00:00:58,422 --> 00:01:02,648
I used to be a Spanish football specialist
for French TV for many years.

8
00:01:02,649 --> 00:01:06,067
And now I work on the Spanish
football in my country, Spain.

9
00:01:18,793 --> 00:01:23,104
We have heard a lot about
the real estate bubble in this country.

10
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:27,821
The exact same thing
happened in football.

11
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:34,340
The bubble has clearly exploded.
A team like Málaga, in the Champions League,

12
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:39,730
with a Qatari owner, an emir just like
the PSG that brought a lot of money,

13
00:01:39,731 --> 00:01:43,165
has difficulties paying the players.

14
00:01:43,166 --> 00:01:48,311
But that didn't just happen to Málaga,
it happened to Rayo Valecano,

15
00:01:48,312 --> 00:01:51,741
last year it happened to Santander
that was downgraded,

16
00:01:51,742 --> 00:01:56,346
it happened to Sporting de Gijón,
and it happened to many other clubs.

17
00:01:56,347 --> 00:01:59,443
It happened to Levanté, that is
in the Europa League today .

18
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:02,774
The transfer of Gareth Bale
to Real Madrid is a fact,

19
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:05,062
according to the announcement made
this Wednesday by COPE radio channel.

20
00:02:05,063 --> 00:02:10,371
The Spanish club agreed with Tottenham
to have the player transfered for 99 million euros.

21
00:02:10,372 --> 00:02:12,672
Three million more than what
Cristiano Ronaldo had costed.

22
00:02:12,673 --> 00:02:15,952
The Spanish football has lived
above its means.

23
00:02:15,953 --> 00:02:21,388
When we compete with someone, we are influenced
by what our competitor does.

24
00:02:22,088 --> 00:02:28,307
Here, Real and Barça create
a huge inflation in the football sector.

25
00:02:28,308 --> 00:02:35,805
Even Valencia and Atletico de Madrid...
So the salaries are totally crazy !

26
00:02:35,806 --> 00:02:42,468
This sort of competition heads us
straight to disaster :

27
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:45,985
"we pay more, we pay the players more,
we have to pay more for those players !"

28
00:02:45,986 --> 00:02:50,138
But how do we do that ?
We borrow money.

29
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:57,505
Why do we receive the money ? Because the institutions,
the banks, everybody wins, it's football !

30
00:02:57,506 --> 00:03:07,144
If the bank finds the money for a new stadium,
they will win a lot so they lend you money to buy a player.

31
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:16,281
We start having players bought by investment
funds from the tax heavens. It happened to Saragossa.

32
00:03:16,282 --> 00:03:26,803
The football sector is in the same financial craziness
that led Spain at the depths of despair.

33
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:36,980
There are more and more people
today that seek work abroad.

34
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:42,285
In the football sector
we clearly have a brain drain.

35
00:03:43,749 --> 00:03:48,181
The biggest star in Manchester City
is a Spaniard.

36
00:03:48,182 --> 00:03:53,942
The biggest star in Liverpool
today is a Spaniard.

37
00:03:53,943 --> 00:04:02,650
And it goes on : in Chelsea, Manchester United,
Juventud, we see Spaniards everywhere.

38
00:04:02,651 --> 00:04:11,713
Even the humble Spaniard, the basic football player
that usually finds a place in second division,

39
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:15,342
or in the worst teams of first
division, is leaving too.

40
00:04:15,343 --> 00:04:20,446
In Greece there are fourty Spanish players ! Fourty !
And we are talking about Greece...

41
00:04:20,447 --> 00:04:24,704
In Cyprus they have Spanish players,
in Russia they have more and more also.

42
00:04:24,705 --> 00:04:29,931
Not only are the middle level
players leaving,

43
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:34,428
But there is a third category of
emigrants : the coaches !

44
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:38,841
Where is Unayemeri ?
Spartak, Moscow.

45
00:04:38,842 --> 00:04:44,034
Where is Garrido, Vila Real's
coach last year ? Bruges, Belgium.

46
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:46,645
We have plenty of cases like this.

47
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:54,190
I read today that Greece is not going to send its
swimming team to the European Championship in France,

48
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:58,274
because they don't have enough money
to pay for the plane tickets.

49
00:04:58,275 --> 00:05:08,924
For these less popular sports,
the situation is scary .

50
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:13,520
But let's take the important sports, like handball.
France is very good in handball, but more importantly

51
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:17,852
France has a very good national team,
the French championship isn't very good.

52
00:05:17,853 --> 00:05:21,654
Germany and Spain have the most important
championships in the world.

53
00:05:22,835 --> 00:05:26,741
Well, today, handball is dead in Spain.

54
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:30,217
Most teams can't pay the salaries.

55
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:37,487
Same story for volleyball : only one team
can go to the European championships

56
00:05:37,488 --> 00:05:39,973
because all the others cannot
pay their plane tickets.

57
00:05:39,974 --> 00:05:44,422
Will football find itself in a similar situation ?
I don't believe so.

58
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:49,612
Because it generates a lot of money,
for televisions for example.

59
00:05:49,613 --> 00:05:53,239
But the future is scary.
For football too.
