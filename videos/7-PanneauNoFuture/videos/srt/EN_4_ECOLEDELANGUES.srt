1
00:00:06,888 --> 00:00:13,799
Nineteen... seventy... five.

2
00:00:19,088 --> 00:00:25,177
My name is Inmaculada Pascual, I  teach German
at the Official Foreign Language School, in Madrid.

3
00:00:25,178 --> 00:00:30,171
We always had a lot of students but now there are
more applications than what we can handle.

4
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,852
In fact, the requests have increased so much,
that we cannot accept anyone else.

5
00:00:36,853 --> 00:00:42,783
Last year we had 74% more applications
than the year before.

6
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:51,320
Nineteen... Ninety… nine.

7
00:00:55,766 --> 00:01:00,581
And this year ?
Two... thousands... eleven.

8
00:01:01,706 --> 00:01:05,677
I'm Jesús, I am 25 years old,
I am an engineer in telecommunications

9
00:01:05,678 --> 00:01:10,774
and I study German because
I need to find work abroad.

10
00:01:10,775 --> 00:01:13,316
I'm not from Madrid,
I'm from another city, Murcia.

11
00:01:13,317 --> 00:01:19,625
Because of the crisis, there's very little work
and I already had to come to Madrid to find a job.

12
00:01:19,626 --> 00:01:24,765
Since there are less and less oportunities here,
I know I have to go abroad.

13
00:01:24,766 --> 00:01:27,778
More out of need
than out of pleasure.

14
00:01:27,779 --> 00:01:33,830
In Holland, Germany, England,
there are far more opportunities.

15
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:38,983
In our department, we receive 
work offers from Germany.

16
00:01:38,984 --> 00:01:42,869
They are looking for people in Spain
that could work in Germany, professionals.

17
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:47,281
Before, those who emigrated were
workers with no qualification.

18
00:01:47,282 --> 00:01:50,257
But now, the well trained
people are leaving,

19
00:01:50,258 --> 00:01:55,082
Spanish engineers are valued
 there, doctors, nurses.

20
00:01:55,117 --> 00:01:59,048
I am a nursing auxiliary.

21
00:02:00,647 --> 00:02:03,163
Does you like that ?
- How did you say ?

22
00:02:03,195 --> 00:02:06,521
Does ? Did ?

23
00:02:06,556 --> 00:02:09,083
Which verbs can't we 
be wrong about ?

24
00:02:09,084 --> 00:02:11,744
This one among others...

25
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:15,719
The auxiliary verbs.
Never. So how does it go ?

26
00:02:17,002 --> 00:02:18,674
Do you like that ?

27
00:02:19,542 --> 00:02:23,508
Where does... 
Mrs Bayer come from ?

28
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:30,262
The Sneider family 
have two children.

29
00:02:33,044 --> 00:02:37,728
I'm Patricia, I'm 26 years old
and I'm an engineer in telecommunications.

30
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:43,138
I'm a PHD student
and I would like to continue in Spain,

31
00:02:43,139 --> 00:02:49,395
but I guess it's going to be difficult
because research is not valued here.

32
00:02:49,696 --> 00:02:53,866
So I think my future is abroad.

33
00:02:53,867 --> 00:02:58,372
For a young person 
that just graduated,

34
00:02:58,373 --> 00:03:02,763
if it's in the technical field,
engineering or something like that,

35
00:03:03,535 --> 00:03:08,218
you might have a possibility in Madrid,
or Barcelona, or Bilbao.

36
00:03:08,219 --> 00:03:12,487
But only as a temporary worker,
with a provisional contract

37
00:03:12,488 --> 00:03:17,355
and a small pay compared
to all the years of study.

38
00:03:19,036 --> 00:03:20,973
And only if you're lucky !

39
00:03:20,974 --> 00:03:26,192
But in most cases,
you won't find anything in Spain.

40
00:03:27,863 --> 00:03:32,809
If you get to work in Germany
for a pizza delivery service,

41
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,611
you have to understand what they're saying
so you don't make mistakes.

42
00:03:40,671 --> 00:03:45,987
- Pizza Express, good evening !
- Good evening, it's Lisa. I would like ten pizzas, please.

43
00:03:45,988 --> 00:03:50,980
- Lisa ? Can you repeat that ?
- Lisa Neumun

44
00:03:52,557 --> 00:03:56,286
- And where do you live Lisa ?
- In Bonn, obviously !

45
00:03:56,287 --> 00:03:59,999
- Yes, in Bonn obviously.
But what is your adress ?

46
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,006
- Beethoven Street 9

47
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:04,773
- Ok, so you would like a pizza ?

48
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:12,976
- No ! Ten pizzas ! So five pizzas n°6
and five pizzas n°12.

49
00:04:22,123 --> 00:04:26,731
Unfortunately, there's an entire
generation, maybe mine and the one after,

50
00:04:26,732 --> 00:04:30,612
that has to go abroad, because there are
a lot of well trained people,

51
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:34,112
but there is not enough work for everyone.
So most of us must go away.

52
00:04:34,513 --> 00:04:38,088
Some will want to do it,
others will have to.

53
00:04:38,089 --> 00:04:42,854
They know how things are, but I don't
see them sad or disappointed.

54
00:04:42,855 --> 00:04:45,335
These people are fighters,
I see people that fight.

55
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:51,526
So they are not afraid to pack their things,
do an Erasmus if they can,

56
00:04:51,527 --> 00:04:54,952
or go to Germany
to study German,

57
00:04:54,953 --> 00:05:01,486
find a job possibility there,
a small job and then stay there.

58
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:06,247
I had students that went there
for a month and then stayed.

59
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:09,134
But then it's true that when
they can, people come back.

60
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:12,407
Their hope for the future
is to come back in Spain.

61
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:29,297
The rate of unemployment for people
under 25 years old exceeds 56%.

62
00:05:30,398 --> 00:05:36,138
In 2012, 200 000 Spaniards
have left the country.
