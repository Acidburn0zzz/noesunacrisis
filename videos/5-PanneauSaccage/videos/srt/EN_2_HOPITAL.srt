00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:18,213
"Public health"

2
00:00:21,662 --> 00:00:26,066
The labour unions of the Community
of Madrid's health sector,

3
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:32,436
totally reject, just as they did
at the beginning of the month,

4
00:00:32,471 --> 00:00:39,326
the guarantee and sustainability Plan
of Madrid's public health system,

5
00:00:39,327 --> 00:00:41,327
announced on October 31st 2012.

6
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:47,161
These measures imply an aggressive
privatization of Madrid's health system, 

7
00:00:47,162 --> 00:00:51,580
by destroying the labour conditions
of health professional employees

8
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:58,823
and by replacing the public management of the health system
with private, profit oriented companies.

9
00:00:58,824 --> 00:01:04,399
This also implies loosing over 7.000 jobs.

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:10,712
As a reaction to these measures,
we now announce the call for a general strike

11
00:01:10,713 --> 00:01:16,689
in the health system of the Community of Madrid,
that will be conducted in the next few days.

12
00:01:24,065 --> 00:01:26,074
You look great !

13
00:01:38,839 --> 00:01:40,562
PUBLIC HEALTH...

14
00:01:40,563 --> 00:01:42,263
… WE DON'T SELL IT, WE DEFEND IT !

15
00:01:42,264 --> 00:01:44,064
PUBLIC HEALTH...

16
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:45,665
… WE DON'T SELL IT, WE DEFEND IT !

17
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:14,380
The government is determined
to continue these measures

18
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:22,021
to adjust budgets 
to low resources. 

19
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:28,462
That means they want to privatize
some public hospitals from Madrid

20
00:02:28,463 --> 00:02:31,763
and transform others 
into specialized centers.

21
00:02:31,764 --> 00:02:35,741
They are dismantling the public
health system as we know it. 

22
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:37,635
Our only wish

23
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,871
is that they don't
privatize hospitals again.

24
00:02:40,872 --> 00:02:44,257
Money here !
Money there !

25
00:02:44,258 --> 00:02:47,700
First the public !
Then the private !

26
00:03:04,706 --> 00:03:09,121
There will be less employees
and less quality,

27
00:03:09,122 --> 00:03:13,222
because they also reformed education
and now people are less trained.

28
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:17,839
The resources will be affected

29
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,096
because health cares will be
taken in charge by private companies,

30
00:03:24,097 --> 00:03:26,864
and every private company
needs to make profit. 

31
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:32,533
Turning health into a firm,
turning patients into clients,

32
00:03:32,534 --> 00:03:36,627
and their treatments could become
just something profitable or not.

33
00:03:36,628 --> 00:03:37,904
That's unacceptable.

34
00:03:38,572 --> 00:03:42,885
All those who want to speak,
all those who have something to say,

35
00:03:42,886 --> 00:03:44,958
can come here !

36
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,263
There is a microphone.

37
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:55,269
Next Tuesday they will dismiss
1.400 people in Marañon Hospital.

38
00:03:55,270 --> 00:04:02,560
They will let go 1.400 people.
Be aware of that !

39
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:07,341
A new executive 
for the health system.

40
00:04:07,342 --> 00:04:10,578
This plan has already been applied
in a Spanish hospital,

41
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:13,398
the hospital of Alcira,
in the Community of Valencia.

42
00:04:13,399 --> 00:04:17,752
The hospital had to outsource its services
and there were no ambulances anymore,

43
00:04:17,753 --> 00:04:23,382
the hospital couldn't pay for ambulances,
nor its therapy oxygen, nor its medicines. 

44
00:04:24,283 --> 00:04:30,814
I remind you that some employees are
occupying the Gregorio Marañon hospital.

45
00:04:30,815 --> 00:04:32,938
- Let's set them free !

46
00:04:36,227 --> 00:04:40,938
There are two more minutes left.
Who wants to make use of it ? 

47
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,715
NO TO BUDGET CUTS
Works Council Gregorio Marañon

48
00:04:44,716 --> 00:04:49,806
It's been five days since we are doing this,
we're all exhausted.

49
00:04:49,807 --> 00:04:54,869
I have never been under so much stress
on a picket line.

50
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:01,609
The truth is that this is very stressful,
to be able to unite our forces in this hospital.

51
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,875
I am only a staff 
representative in a hospital.

52
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:10,886
But I know that my colleagues and I
sent a message to our union leaders,

53
00:05:10,887 --> 00:05:15,676
they must make an effort to unite
the combat in the health system.

54
00:05:15,677 --> 00:05:17,826
And they must do that now.

55
00:05:17,827 --> 00:05:20,428
They must make an effort 
to make this possible,

56
00:05:20,429 --> 00:05:23,447
to make the coordinators, the platforms,
the groups or whatever,

57
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:25,743
say the same thing.

58
00:05:30,613 --> 00:05:32,252
One more thing.

59
00:05:32,753 --> 00:05:37,241
There have been some discussions,
that will be brought up again at the 3.30 p.m assembly,

60
00:05:37,242 --> 00:05:42,033
on the role of unions.
Keep the unions out of this.

61
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:48,107
Look, this is an internal matter, and the unions have guided us,
they have supported us and I am very thankful to them.

62
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:52,278
Because we are not able to organize ourselves
for something this important,

63
00:05:52,279 --> 00:05:55,639
and we pretend to do this alone.
That doesn't make any sense to me !

64
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:59,658
For those who don't like unions, well,
try to organize things differently,

65
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,992
but as we are not organized yet,
I wish you good luck.

66
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:06,289
Thank you very much.

67
00:06:10,424 --> 00:06:15,950
"Budget cuts in health kill"

68
00:06:22,384 --> 00:06:26,453
Yes Marta, we are live at
the Medical College of Madrid...

69
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:30,151
This is absolutely extraordinary...

70
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:40,905
YES, WE CAN !

71
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:11,396
As I said, today,
it's a very important day.

72
00:07:11,997 --> 00:07:15,792
For the first time, 
a strike was conducted by doctors.

73
00:07:16,393 --> 00:07:19,591
We, doctors, have never really liked strikes,
we don't know how to do it,

74
00:07:19,592 --> 00:07:22,754
we are not professionals,
we're not a labour union.

75
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:25,506
And we don't know 
anything about strikes.

76
00:07:25,507 --> 00:07:28,352
It pisses us off 
to go on strike !

77
00:07:28,953 --> 00:07:33,285
And mostly : an unlimited strike
is a difficult strike.

78
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:39,112
But we are in this. And I'm sure
that we did the right thing.

79
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:41,284
We did what we had to do.

80
00:07:41,285 --> 00:07:47,358
We started an unlimited strike and we have
to walk out of it with our heads held high.

81
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:58,189
We must keep our strength !

82
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:02,136
We have to continue until
they ask for negotiations. 

83
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:12,752
People have to see us on TV,
down in the streets.

84
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:15,393
We have to keep explaining people

85
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:19,153
that we cannot agree with this reform.
We have to make them support us,

86
00:08:19,293 --> 00:08:21,388
to make them join our demonstrations.

87
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:24,922
So that everybody understands that
this strike is not meant to annoy anyone.

88
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:30,715
We do this because there is no other way
to explain them what we really want.

89
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:41,192
PATIENTS ! LISTEN !
THIS FIGHT IS FOR YOU !

90
00:08:43,665 --> 00:08:48,344
The spirit of the 15M
is within the meetings,

91
00:08:48,345 --> 00:08:53,816
neighbor meetings, hospital employees meetings
or education employees meetings.

92
00:08:53,817 --> 00:08:55,722
This spirit is still alive.

93
00:08:55,723 --> 00:08:58,978
Now it's not the 15M anymore,
it's far bigger than the 15M. 

94
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:00,586
Colleagues !

95
00:09:01,963 --> 00:09:04,492
This meeting will end now.

96
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:08,986
I invite you all to the
general meeting in Sol,

97
00:09:08,987 --> 00:09:14,291
that will take place next
Sunday at 12 a.m here.

98
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:19,391
This assembly is always the place for us
to do what we are doing now,

99
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:22,292
to talk about what we want to talk about.

100
00:09:22,293 --> 00:09:24,971
To claim what we want to claim.

101
00:09:24,972 --> 00:09:30,310
And to complain about the thousands of things
that we are allowed to complain about.

102
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:37,337
Good luck to you all
and see you all next week.
