1
00:00:02,870 --> 00:00:05,229
We won't step back !

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:08,830
We are going to
overcome this struggle !

3
00:00:08,904 --> 00:00:11,804
GENERAL STRIKE !

4
00:00:17,512 --> 00:00:22,506
Come on, bicycles !

5
00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:24,964
We're going to take
another street !

6
00:00:24,965 --> 00:00:27,046
Go bicycles !

7
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:35,077
Today we don't consume !
Today we don't work !

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:53,753
Less police and
more education !

9
00:00:57,504 --> 00:01:04,908
We are the elderlies !
We are indignants !

10
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:11,064
I am a retired woman.

11
00:01:11,065 --> 00:01:15,136
But it's not right to abandon the youth,
nor the children, nor the families.

12
00:01:15,137 --> 00:01:17,943
And the Church doesn't give a shit !

13
00:01:18,444 --> 00:01:23,285
They were only here to protest
against the gay marriage !

14
00:01:23,286 --> 00:01:25,138
And the families are thrown
out in the street ?

15
00:01:25,139 --> 00:01:27,580
Where is this Church now ?

16
00:01:27,581 --> 00:01:29,666
Damn it !

17
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:38,254
What is happening ?
We don't have a home !

18
00:01:40,773 --> 00:01:46,218
I am protesting because
the bank stole my house.

19
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:51,158
On sale :
Your hospital ! Your dignity ! Your health !

20
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,072
Public health !

21
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:59,055
Because we don't have
to pay for this crisis !

22
00:01:59,156 --> 00:02:02,543
Because they're not ashamed
of what they're doing !

23
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:06,619
We must fight for our rights ! We must continue !
And they won't overthrow us, we will overthrow them !

24
00:02:06,681 --> 00:02:09,396
Please continue with us !

25
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:17,441
I am now at the Princesa Hospital.
But I'll go back home after.

26
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,052
He always comes...

27
00:02:23,053 --> 00:02:27,491
It's our friend
« el pajarito ». The little bird. 

28
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:41,506
The law specifies that your
right of movement is limited,

29
00:02:41,507 --> 00:02:46,141
that you can't protest,
that you can't go to meetings.

30
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:50,706
This is called a state of exception.
It's controlled. 

31
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,547
I am 75 years old.

32
00:03:07,548 --> 00:03:11,407
Our bank ripped us off.

33
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:16,850
They scammed us, they stole all
the savings we had to end our life with.

34
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:19,333
The government let us down,
the bank let us down,

35
00:03:19,334 --> 00:03:24,238
The Public Treasury let us down,
everybody abandoned us.

36
00:03:24,273 --> 00:03:27,435
We are a million
cheated elderlies.

37
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:29,981
One million in Spain !

38
00:03:33,066 --> 00:03:35,325
RAJOY SON OF A BITCH  !!!

39
00:03:42,176 --> 00:03:45,452
YES, WE CAN !
