1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,886
Since the beginning of the crisis,
budget cuts fall one after another.

2
00:00:11,488 --> 00:00:15,271
Austerity, an insurmountable horizon.

3
00:00:17,201 --> 00:00:22,051
In the universities, endowments are being reduced,
classes are being removed,

4
00:00:22,052 --> 00:00:26,061
education fees are being increased,
and everything is being privatized.

5
00:00:29,352 --> 00:00:34,070
The University of Complutense is one
of the major ones in Madrid.

6
00:00:34,371 --> 00:00:40,083
It is also knows as one of the bastions
of resistance against the governmental reforms.

7
00:00:40,084 --> 00:00:44,370
An incubator for the indignant
movement of the 1st of May 2011.

8
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,494
Ángeles Diez Rodriguez is a sociologist.

9
00:00:48,495 --> 00:00:51,546
She took part actively in the 15M movement.

10
00:00:51,547 --> 00:00:55,640
She denounces the reforms applied in the University.

11
00:00:56,099 --> 00:00:59,306
A new model is being implemented. 

12
00:00:59,307 --> 00:01:01,965
It is a liberal model,

13
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:07,503
one that is supposedly trying to turn
public university into a profitable thing.

14
00:01:08,304 --> 00:01:10,941
This action has various consequences.

15
00:01:10,942 --> 00:01:17,748
Only degrees, in this case
masters and doctoral degrees,

16
00:01:17,749 --> 00:01:22,863
that interest firms, 
will receive funds.

17
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:28,150
Other disciplines like
human sciences, linguistics,

18
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:31,376
or anything that represents 
the general knowledge,

19
00:01:31,377 --> 00:01:35,390
and a foundation for
a people and a country,

20
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:39,567
will be relegated.
They will become secondary,

21
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:42,218
and eventually they 
might even disappear :

22
00:01:42,219 --> 00:01:45,790
philosophy, sociology,
political sciences...

23
00:01:45,791 --> 00:01:48,229
Because this change of model
is their project.

24
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:53,179
A liberalizing model,
in which the firms will participate directly

25
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:57,863
in the decisions, management and
policy of public universities.

26
00:01:57,864 --> 00:02:02,172
At the same time, there is
a deviation of public funds

27
00:02:02,173 --> 00:02:07,783
which are no longer invested into the public universities
and go to the private universities instead .

28
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:14,071
This way, those funds are
now fueling mostly

29
00:02:14,072 --> 00:02:17,212
the education and training
of this country's elite. 

30
00:02:18,284 --> 00:02:23,180
The University of Complutense is now
flirting with the cessation of payment

31
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:27,931
because of the budget cuts
it has suffered from.

32
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:33,645
At the same time, education fees
have literally bursted.

33
00:02:34,184 --> 00:02:37,652
The increase of the registration fees
have been spectacular.

34
00:02:40,029 --> 00:02:45,707
Until last year, the students
were paying around 600 euros

35
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:49,674
for a complete academic year.

36
00:02:49,675 --> 00:02:52,768
But now they pay 1.300 euros.

37
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:57,519
For non-scientific masters degrees,

38
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,573
that don't involve laboratory work,

39
00:03:03,001 --> 00:03:09,172
they are paying at least 
1.500, 2.000 euros

40
00:03:09,173 --> 00:03:13,157
but otherwise it goes up
to 4.000, 5.000 euros.

41
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:19,221
Most of the families in this country
cannot afford these amounts.

42
00:03:21,236 --> 00:03:24,351
With almost 6 million 
of unemployed workers,

43
00:03:25,397 --> 00:03:30,918
that makes it impossible for the working class
and the middle class children

44
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,884
to have access to universities.

45
00:03:38,804 --> 00:03:44,404
4 years to study, 40 to repay.

46
00:03:44,405 --> 00:03:51,974
The educated youth, trained
with the public funds

47
00:03:51,975 --> 00:03:54,798
is leaving the country.

48
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,366
They only think of one thing : 
finishing my studies,

49
00:03:58,367 --> 00:03:59,909
and getting away from here.

50
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,990
But I tell them to stay and
fight in this country.

51
00:04:02,991 --> 00:04:06,754
Because if there's nobody here to fight 
for change, this country will drown.

52
00:04:06,756 --> 00:04:12,172
Ángeles Diez Rodriguez fights
to defend public university.

53
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:19,071
Cruz Diez, a young teacher from Madrid,
struggles for public education,

54
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:23,243
also threatened by 
the budget cuts.

55
00:04:24,388 --> 00:04:27,391
For the government it's easy
to cut into the budget :

56
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,801
"we'll remove two hours from here,
one hour from there".

57
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:37,109
But then, you are the one confronted to the class rooms
with those who are directly affected by these cuts.

58
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:41,607
I'm the one who sees
Julia who cannot benefit

59
00:04:41,608 --> 00:04:45,665
from math tutoring
though she needs it,

60
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:49,528
Pedro who just arrived 
from Columbia

61
00:04:49,529 --> 00:04:53,889
and could use some support
but he can not receive it,

62
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:58,030
or Juliana who cannot pay
for her school books.

63
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:01,518
For the government it's only a cut here or there
but I see those cuts.

64
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:05,410
I see them and it hurts.

65
00:05:05,411 --> 00:05:07,950
Because here, those cuts have names.

66
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:12,001
And in my case, as a teacher,
they are children.

67
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,679
And it hurts to see that.

68
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:19,589
There are three types of school:
private, where you pay for all the costs ;

69
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:27,966
the contracted school, where the government
and the families share the costs,

70
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:32,363
and the public school where the students
pay only for their books.

71
00:05:32,992 --> 00:05:34,588
Do you know what the problem is ?

72
00:05:34,589 --> 00:05:42,292
With their budget cuts, they are
destroying the quality of public education.

73
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:45,225
This is turning the public school into a "ghetto",

74
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:49,969
only for students that can not afford
the private one or the concertada one. 

75
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:53,485
It's our turn to talk.

76
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:56,387
We're not demonstrating
for two extra hours of work.

77
00:05:56,388 --> 00:05:59,883
We're doing it because our children
don't have the attention they deserve.

78
00:05:59,884 --> 00:06:04,112
In my high school there isn't enough space,
so some classes take place in a greenhouse.

79
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:08,122
We don't have access to the library
because there aren't enough teachers.

80
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:12,919
Cruz Diez is part of the
Marea Verde, the Green Tide.

81
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:19,262
A group that gathers for the first time
teachers, members of unions and the student's parents.

82
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:22,924
All united to defend
the Spanish public education.

83
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:25,966
Last year in my language class
we were 20, this year we are 28.

84
00:06:25,967 --> 00:06:30,688
My dream is that every high school
from the Community of Madrid be an excellent one.

85
00:06:30,689 --> 00:06:33,840
Mine, too.

86
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:35,141
Join the Green Tide. 

87
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,332
The Green Tide gathered a lot
of people, really a lot,

88
00:06:42,506 --> 00:06:47,033
were a lot of wishes, a lot of effort,
a lot of time spent. We did all kinds of actions :

89
00:06:47,034 --> 00:06:52,866
demonstrations, we wrote to the press,
we wrote letters, gathered signatures,

90
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:55,926
anything you can imagine, we did it.

91
00:06:55,927 --> 00:06:59,197
But we couldn't stop
the budget cuts.

92
00:06:59,198 --> 00:07:01,519
They even became 
more and more severe.

93
00:07:04,562 --> 00:07:08,435
The social movements, the 15M movement
had some small victories,

94
00:07:08,436 --> 00:07:13,271
with education, with health,
but non essential issues.

95
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,711
It is hard for me.

96
00:07:15,746 --> 00:07:18,739
It is hard to be positive 
about the future.

97
00:07:20,621 --> 00:07:23,946
I rather not think about it.
Because if I look into the future,

98
00:07:23,947 --> 00:07:28,040
I see myself out of Spain,
or in a violent country.

99
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:33,680
As I see this country
getting worst everyday,

100
00:07:33,681 --> 00:07:37,575
I don't believe we will be able
to avoid violence much longer.

101
00:07:37,876 --> 00:07:41,721
Because people are having
 a very hard time.

102
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:45,276
Obviously, when you get to a point
where you have nothing left to eat,

103
00:07:45,277 --> 00:07:47,505
what would you do ?
Steal.

104
00:07:47,506 --> 00:07:50,831
I believe it's something natural.

105
00:07:51,732 --> 00:07:54,631
Stealing, violence...
I don't know...

106
00:07:56,455 --> 00:08:00,647
I don't see the future
of Spain looking so bright.
