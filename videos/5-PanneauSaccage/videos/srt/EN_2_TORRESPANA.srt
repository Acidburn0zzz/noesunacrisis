1
00:00:05,974 --> 00:00:08,739
Spanish journalism is in crisis.

2
00:00:10,442 --> 00:00:15,039
Everywhere in the editorial boards, people
are dismissed, budgets are cut or worst,

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,011
newspapers are being shut down.

4
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:24,857
El País, the most important daily newspapers
in the country, is not spared.

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:30,113
Ramon Muñoz is one of the journalists working there. 
He just published an essay on the crisis,

6
00:00:30,114 --> 00:00:36,422
“Spain, a third-world destination”.
A blunt and pessimistic view on this country's future.

7
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:43,231
When it comes to media in Spain,
his opinion is just as sharp.

8
00:00:43,772 --> 00:00:47,049
The situation of the press
in Spain is absolutely terrible.

9
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:54,263
No other field, not even construction, has suffered
from the crisis as journalism does.

10
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:56,164
None, absolutely none.

11
00:00:56,165 --> 00:01:00,059
This year only, 10.000 journalists
have been dismissed.

12
00:01:00,094 --> 00:01:04,082
And every day other
medias are disappearing.

13
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:08,315
And those of us who remain,
who still have a job,

14
00:01:08,316 --> 00:01:12,197
we see how our work conditions,
and not just the pays,

15
00:01:12,198 --> 00:01:18,076
but our independence in general, are falling apart day after day. 
- Do you experience the same situation here at El País ?

16
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:22,731
I'm going to avoid your question,
and I apologize for that.

17
00:01:22,732 --> 00:01:28,370
We just had a social plan
that affected 129 of my colleagues.

18
00:01:28,371 --> 00:01:33,138
As I declared before, in other interviews,
I'm not...

19
00:01:33,139 --> 00:01:35,372
No but I want things to be told...

20
00:01:35,373 --> 00:01:39,778
I'm not cut out to be a hero,
and I like my job very much.

21
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:42,101
With this I believe I have
somehow answered your question.

22
00:01:46,097 --> 00:01:52,142
Every day the journalists still working here
in El País, count their dismissed colleagues.

23
00:01:52,143 --> 00:01:58,262
They know, their newspaper,
no matter its prestige, is threatened.

24
00:02:03,966 --> 00:02:11,141
Different scenery. The El Diario editorial,
an information website created two years ago.

25
00:02:11,947 --> 00:02:17,943
In the Spanish media landscape,
El Diario is a sort of alien.

26
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:23,841
It is rare for publishers to be labeled left wing,
and to closely monitor the indignant movement.

27
00:02:23,842 --> 00:02:27,270
Juan Lu Sánchez is the 
assistant editor there.

28
00:02:27,562 --> 00:02:30,689
The medias in Spain are
more and more standardized,

29
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,642
because it's more and more complicated
for those who have alternative convictions

30
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:37,710
to obtain the funds to express them.

31
00:02:37,711 --> 00:02:45,491
That is why, most of the companies
that own a digital terrestrian TV channel

32
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:52,128
belong to corporations very, very close
to the right wing parties.

33
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:58,222
The print media,
despite its difficulties,

34
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:03,203
finds money more easily thanks to
advertising of through indirect funding,

35
00:03:03,204 --> 00:03:05,989
such as the institutionnal 
funds for communication.

36
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:12,671
The newspapers remain very conservative aspecially
since the Popular Party is ruling.

37
00:03:12,672 --> 00:03:16,371
And because of this also,
the medias are disconnected from reality.

38
00:03:16,372 --> 00:03:20,802
All the demonstrations we have seen
the past two years in Spain

39
00:03:20,803 --> 00:03:24,224
are definitely against
the economic management of the crisis,

40
00:03:24,225 --> 00:03:28,714
but also against the way the medias
are talking about the crisis.

41
00:03:31,816 --> 00:03:34,882
Javier Gallego is a radio journalist.

42
00:03:34,883 --> 00:03:39,605
He is known in Spain for his debate show
"Carne Cruda", "raw meet".

43
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:43,416
A show without compromising,
that criticized the power,

44
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:46,540
and which was removed overnight
from the Spanish public radio,

45
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:50,260
censured as many other
programs these days. 

46
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:54,369
One can just take a look at the broadcasts
and mostly the news programs 

47
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:59,500
to see where the public radio
and television are heading towards.

48
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:06,648
They are trying to hide from the people
part of what is happening today.

49
00:04:06,649 --> 00:04:12,049
Some of my colleagues from the public radio
are informing me about the instructions they receive,

50
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:17,801
they're not allowed to deal with  some topics,
they must hide others, disguise some realities.

51
00:04:17,802 --> 00:04:25,029
Most of all never criticize in a violent way the government
for its austerity policies and its savage budget cuts.

52
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:31,928
All we have to do is look at this country to see the pride
and satisfaction when people say "Viva España !"

53
00:04:31,929 --> 00:04:38,275
Long live Spain ! The country that beet its record
of unemployment, with almost 4 420 642 unemployed people.

54
00:04:38,276 --> 00:04:41,723
A historical record ! 
Twice as much as last November !

55
00:04:41,724 --> 00:04:45,823
60.000 more than in October !
The forth consecutive increase !

56
00:04:45,824 --> 00:04:47,511
But of course : "Viva España !"

57
00:04:47,512 --> 00:04:52,224
The country where the only family with a job
for life as a birthright, the royal family,

58
00:04:52,225 --> 00:04:56,849
has a son in law who used his position to make millions in business
with Valencia's and Mayorque's public money,

59
00:04:56,849 --> 00:05:00,677
but of course : "Viva España !"
Oh... Long live Spain !  

60
00:05:00,772 --> 00:05:05,900
Under the former government,
we were all very critical with the medias,

61
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,565
the national television and radio.

62
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:12,442
But if being critical is very good,
we realize what we have lost.

63
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:14,167
Because things have changed.

64
00:05:14,168 --> 00:05:15,380
Clearly. 

65
00:05:15,381 --> 00:05:19,971
For this neo-liberal government,

66
00:05:19,972 --> 00:05:24,286
public televisions and radios
cost too much,

67
00:05:24,687 --> 00:05:28,671
they don't fulfill their part
and should disappear.

68
00:05:29,072 --> 00:05:34,715
But for me, the danger is that precisely because of
this manipulation of the information,

69
00:05:34,716 --> 00:05:37,256
they might loose their audience,
because people reject

70
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:42,754
a message that is not impartial
and that doesn't represent the truth.

71
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:48,446
And when the audience decreases,
they have the perfect excuse to say

72
00:05:48,947 --> 00:05:54,535
"we will close it down, it doesn't work,
people don't care about public media".

73
00:05:54,536 --> 00:05:56,172
Strengthening private medias.

74
00:05:56,173 --> 00:05:58,598
This is what is happening
with journalism,

75
00:05:58,599 --> 00:06:01,574
but also within all areas
of the Spanish society today.

76
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:06,320
Make the public management look inefficient
so that they can privatize it.

77
00:06:08,948 --> 00:06:14,559
TELEMADRID !
How to destroy a public service ? 

78
00:06:20,195 --> 00:06:25,580
First, she devastates a public
service with a bad management.

79
00:06:25,581 --> 00:06:28,635
Then she tells us that
there are too many workers,

80
00:06:28,636 --> 00:06:32,182
and that private management is better.

81
00:06:32,683 --> 00:06:37,511
"Very well. Then let someone else
take care of it. I resign"

82
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:45,991
Then the manager thinks of 
a different solution…

83
00:06:49,676 --> 00:06:53,042
"We will do a social plan of dismissals
or shut the television down !"

84
00:06:54,727 --> 00:07:01,583
The public medias are very useful
to defend the social values,

85
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:07,890
because we are aware of the fact
that the private medias, the big corporations

86
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:10,249
will not defend these social values.

87
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,686
Since the conservatives parties don't have
any interest in defending social values,

88
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,676
they dismantle the public medias,

89
00:07:17,677 --> 00:07:22,672
they cut their budgets, they drain them
and destroy their credibility,

90
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:28,106
in order to support the private medias
who follow the same ideology as they do.

91
00:07:28,107 --> 00:07:33,186
The problem is that in Spain we have a dangerous
marriage between politics and journalism.

92
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,801
They are hand in hand !

93
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:40,082
They defend the same values while
journalism should be criticizing the power

94
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:44,585
and should always question its actions.

95
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:48,706
Unfortunately through the financial power
that gives funds to the political power,

96
00:07:48,707 --> 00:07:51,730
journalism is also being financed
so at the end they're all in this together.

97
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:55,919
That is like a caste, who hates the citizen
who takes the street to demonstrate

98
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,311
because he wishes to be well informed,
to be able to actually participate in the democracy,

99
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,422
and who wants this
corrupt system to reset.

100
00:08:02,423 --> 00:08:03,609
What happened ?

101
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:08,063
Well, this citizen, that anywhere else in the world
would be considered as well thought out,

102
00:08:08,064 --> 00:08:11,554
is called violent, anti-system.
He is disqualified.

103
00:08:11,555 --> 00:08:14,798
Why ? Because they want to
preserve their statu-quo.

104
00:08:14,799 --> 00:08:17,094
The line that nobody can cross :

105
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:21,843
in democracy you can criticize as long as you respect the law,
and if not you become nothing less than a delinquent.

106
00:08:21,844 --> 00:08:24,237
What they are doing here is delinquency.

107
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:27,559
La Razón newspaper qualifies them
loud and clear as anti-system.

108
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:30,187
Do we look like anti-system ?

109
00:08:30,188 --> 00:08:32,988
And those we support ?
Do they look like anti-system ?

110
00:08:33,447 --> 00:08:39,181
Despite their willing to destroy
the credibility of the 15M,

111
00:08:39,182 --> 00:08:43,599
medias are actually talking about the topics
brought in discussion by the 15M.

112
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:48,085
The 15M was the first to talk about
the property evictions, the end of free health service,

113
00:08:48,086 --> 00:08:51,382
the budget cuts, the indignation.

114
00:08:51,383 --> 00:08:56,598
All these subjects that are now on the front page
of all newspapers, including the right-wing ones.

115
00:08:56,599 --> 00:09:00,085
They're talking about the 15M
without even realizing it !
