1
00:00:00,948 --> 00:00:04,244
We are the elderlies !
But we are not afraid !

2
00:00:12,444 --> 00:00:14,152
This is our square !

3
00:00:14,153 --> 00:00:17,717
You, the one looking at us !
They are stealing from you too !

4
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:26,332
I won't repay
a euro for a prescription  !

5
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,236
They are attacking
 the middle class.

6
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:31,938
My children will loose 3.000 euros.

7
00:00:34,094 --> 00:00:38,616
- Tell the story to the camera !
- 3.000 euros ! They lost their bonus.

8
00:00:38,617 --> 00:00:42,079
They are civil servants.
Their bonus were not paid.

9
00:00:43,365 --> 00:00:45,713
Consumption will collapse.

10
00:00:46,114 --> 00:00:50,452
This is a consequence 
of budget cuts.

11
00:00:50,453 --> 00:00:54,868
This policy is insane
from all points of view,

12
00:00:54,869 --> 00:01:00,164
because it keeps taking more and more from people.
For example, before, with my pension,

13
00:01:00,165 --> 00:01:03,916
I could afford to go
to the movies, to the theater,

14
00:01:03,917 --> 00:01:07,778
to dinner or just eat something out.
Now I cannot afford that anymore.

15
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:10,922
Because I have to be careful
with all the cuts in my budget.

16
00:01:10,923 --> 00:01:13,926
They are liars because
they lied to the population.

17
00:01:13,927 --> 00:01:17,902
Only a politician can do that.
Rajoy, resignation !

18
00:01:18,403 --> 00:01:23,530
Puerta del Sol is
the main square of Madrid.

19
00:01:23,531 --> 00:01:30,561
This is where the 15M was born, 
where all the ideas go through, 

20
00:01:30,562 --> 00:01:33,993
and the Yayoflautas,
we want to be here too.

21
00:01:33,994 --> 00:01:42,632
We have lost most of our rights, including liberties
that took us 40 years to obtain.

22
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:45,833
Pilar !

23
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:52,023
Every four years we vote
for political programs.

24
00:01:52,924 --> 00:01:58,545
At the end they apply the contrary of what we voted for,
so there's very little democracy left.

25
00:01:58,546 --> 00:02:04,461
The current government is following
a completely opposite policy

26
00:02:04,462 --> 00:02:07,921
than the one they promised us
in their electoral program.

27
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:12,105
What's left of the democratic legitimacy ?
Nothing !

28
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,790
I think that Spaniards biggest problem

29
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:32,022
is that once we got democracy, we thought 
it was for life and that's not true.

30
00:02:32,023 --> 00:02:36,369
Democracy needs to be fought
for day after day.

31
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:42,985
Otherwise it gets corrupted. Like still water.

32
00:02:42,986 --> 00:02:46,001
And this is what
we have in Spain today.

33
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:57,139
We're going to be famous !
In France, and everywhere else !

34
00:03:00,425 --> 00:03:05,812
My name is Pilar Goytre. I am 65 years old
and I just retired.

35
00:03:05,813 --> 00:03:09,312
I have three children 
and three grandchildren.

36
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:15,742
I dedicate myself today
to the Yayoflautas movement.

37
00:03:18,183 --> 00:03:21,678
My father was a military and my mother
didn't work, she stayed at home.

38
00:03:21,679 --> 00:03:25,039
We were nine brothers and sisters
and we are all still alive.

39
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,933
Since we were a lot in the house,
and my father was only a military,

40
00:03:29,023 --> 00:03:32,152
only the boys 
got to have a career.

41
00:03:32,153 --> 00:03:36,652
There was not enough money
to allow girls to have a career.

42
00:03:36,653 --> 00:03:42,393
So we had to look for work.
I studied to be a secretary,

43
00:03:42,794 --> 00:03:45,805
and finally things turned 
out quite well for me.

44
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:53,695
The birth of Yayoflautas
was a result of the 15M movement.

45
00:03:53,696 --> 00:03:56,672
We joined all
the demonstrations,

46
00:03:56,673 --> 00:04:01,015
we supported the people evicted from their homes
because that's what hurts us the most.

47
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:04,709
We participated in all
the hospital gatherings.

48
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:10,548
Besides our own actions
we collaborate with those who need us.

49
00:04:10,549 --> 00:04:14,668
And people ask for our 
cooperation more and more !

50
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:19,026
We are just like a tank, moving slowly,
but moving, we keep moving forward…

51
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:24,212
And we are patient. We are almost all
retired so we are not in a hurry.

52
00:04:26,095 --> 00:04:29,507
"GENERAL STRIKE !"

53
00:04:35,427 --> 00:04:42,510
We are old !
And we are indignants !

54
00:04:42,511 --> 00:04:46,012
The next unemployed
should be a Congressman !

55
00:04:46,013 --> 00:04:51,445
Botella [current mayor of Madrid]
does not understand anything !

56
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:57,975
We want them to see that we,
old people, not just the 90 years old,

57
00:04:57,976 --> 00:05:03,663
because some of us are 50 or 60,
we can do a lot of things.

58
00:05:03,664 --> 00:05:07,007
We won't stay at home feeling
sorry for ourselves,

59
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:11,467
watching television and saying "what a disaster,
everything is falling appart, we can't do anything".

60
00:05:11,468 --> 00:05:16,057
Of course we can, we can go out in the street
and fight next to those children,

61
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:21,843
put some pressure to make things better
or at least stop them from getting worst.

62
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:25,703
If you protest, the government
might say they won't give up,

63
00:05:25,704 --> 00:05:30,536
they might say "we won't change anything
even if you go out in the streets",

64
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:33,294
finally they will end up
doing something.

65
00:05:33,295 --> 00:05:39,302
Five years of crisis,
people can't handle this anymore.

66
00:05:39,303 --> 00:05:43,438
In every family there is someone
unemployed. In every family.

67
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,664
And there are families
where everybody is unemployed.

68
00:05:51,665 --> 00:05:59,509
And everywhere in the newspapers, on television,
they keep telling you that we have to help each other,

69
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,817
that social services
are offering soup kitchens,

70
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:10,706
that Caritas can't feed everybody anymore
because there's no more money.

71
00:06:10,707 --> 00:06:12,942
We see that everywhere.

72
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:17,031
The Yayoflautas is a movement
of mature people,

73
00:06:17,032 --> 00:06:23,776
who believe that what is happening today
in Spain is absolutely unfair.

74
00:06:23,777 --> 00:06:28,771
that the society didn't cause this crisis
and that we don't have to pay for it.

75
00:06:28,772 --> 00:06:36,989
There's no reason why we should loose
our social rights, because we acquired them.

76
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:44,903
We believe the crisis can be stopped in another way
and without always cutting downward.

77
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:52,921
We are ready to fight as long as
it takes to defend our rights,

78
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:58,356
and the rights of our children, and the rights of our grandchildren.
We don't want to go back to Franco's time.

79
00:06:58,357 --> 00:07:03,801
We know what that means and we don't want that.
So we will fight to stop that from happening.
