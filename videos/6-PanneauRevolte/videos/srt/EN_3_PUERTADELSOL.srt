1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:08,626
It is time.

2
00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:13,113
It is time to bring the light
inside the cages.

3
00:00:13,148 --> 00:00:15,889
To break down the walls of words
telling us that everything will be fine,

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:22,890
telling us that something else is impossible,
that the laws of nature made us what we are.

5
00:00:24,573 --> 00:00:28,707
It is time to no longer listen to the speeches
telling us that everything is balanced,

6
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:33,901
that justice has nothing to do with this
and that there's nothing we can do about it.

7
00:00:36,294 --> 00:00:38,949
We will do something about it. 

8
00:00:47,552 --> 00:00:51,431
The 15M movement is an awakening,
a sudden awakening,

9
00:00:51,432 --> 00:00:58,750
in a time where this was absolutely necessary
because we were totally asleep.

10
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:06,906
This is the most
remarkable event in Spain

11
00:01:06,907 --> 00:01:09,821
since the death
of Franco in 1975.

12
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:15,741
"We are the 99%", and that
is the key to everything.

13
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:20,407
The 15M made a difference
 in history.

14
00:01:23,904 --> 00:01:29,908
YES, WE CAN !

15
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:34,376
Today, we wish to put
aside our own symbols,

16
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:38,574
our own private interests,
because we wish to prove

17
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:42,664
that what joins us all
together is indignation !

18
00:01:42,665 --> 00:01:47,018
Against government's abuses,
against big corporations,

19
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:50,045
against financial entities !

20
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,136
And most of all, we want
an unconditional democracy,

21
00:01:56,137 --> 00:02:03,089
a democracy that is not reduced by an unstoppable,
dehumanized, destructive neoliberalism !

22
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:10,892
In spring 2011,
five or six major elements

23
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:13,777
were joined together
in an almost magical way.

24
00:02:13,778 --> 00:02:15,859
The first, obviously, 
is the crisis.

25
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,324
Based on this central idea
that governments were busier

26
00:02:20,325 --> 00:02:26,328
helping private companies who had 
speculated, than citizens.

27
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:31,209
Second element : the protests generated
by the crisis in the universities.

28
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:37,337
The Bologna Plan created
a chaos in the universities.

29
00:02:37,338 --> 00:02:42,989
It is not surprising that most of the young people
camping at the beginning, were students.

30
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,621
Third :

31
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:48,381
the agenda of May 2011,

32
00:02:48,382 --> 00:02:53,952
with some dull provincial 
and mayoral elections.

33
00:02:53,953 --> 00:02:57,132
That was a good opportunity
for the movement

34
00:02:57,133 --> 00:03:02,508
to bring to the table
a few concealed topics.

35
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:08,556
Forth, the symbol of the Arab spring,
which I believe is more important that it seems.

36
00:03:08,642 --> 00:03:13,804
Fifth and last element is the background work
done by the alternative social movements.

37
00:03:13,805 --> 00:03:19,384
The 15M went out in the street
with a political claim :

38
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:21,292
"they don't represent us !"

39
00:03:21,293 --> 00:03:23,348
And to me this is very important,

40
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:26,850
because it wasn't 
a corporative claim saying :

41
00:03:26,851 --> 00:03:31,102
"they are leaving me without a job",
or "my rights are being taken from me".

42
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:37,687
We went out in the street with the idea that 
"they are calling this democracy, but this isn't one"

43
00:03:41,088 --> 00:03:47,959
THEY ARE CALLING THIS DEMOCRACY,
BUT THIS ISN'T ONE !

44
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:59,950
It was a tremendous rise
of energy. Tremendous.

45
00:03:59,951 --> 00:04:05,775
We knew that people were going
to respond to our call because we could feel it...

46
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:12,620
Thanks to the communication work
of over 400 groups supporting us.

47
00:04:12,713 --> 00:04:16,447
I was first surprised by the
number of people present there.

48
00:04:16,448 --> 00:04:18,949
Then, by the ability 
of organizing things…

49
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,274
I found myself in a
very organized demonstration.

50
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:26,021
And then, I had the 
pleasant surprise

51
00:04:26,022 --> 00:04:29,597
of seeing a great diversity 
of people there.

52
00:04:29,598 --> 00:04:34,151
I am a teacher in a business 
school, I am a liberal,

53
00:04:34,152 --> 00:04:39,844
not a radical one, 
not a conservative,

54
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:41,994
but I tend to be liberal.

55
00:04:41,995 --> 00:04:45,503
I found myself there next to
people from anarchist movements,

56
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:47,336
next to communists...

57
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:49,739
and I dearly remember 
this grandpa

58
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,904
who climbed onto a mailbox,
who had an old republican flag.

59
00:04:53,905 --> 00:05:00,743
It seemed as if he had taken
that banner out, straight from 1935 !

60
00:05:00,744 --> 00:05:04,640
I hoped he would not fall,
or he could have broken his back !

61
00:05:04,641 --> 00:05:07,713
There were people of all ages,

62
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:10,147
students, from my 
business school,

63
00:05:10,148 --> 00:05:15,384
people from the right wing, left wing, a little bit of everything.
That really draw my attention.

64
00:05:15,385 --> 00:05:19,077
Nobody had managed to make so many different
people get out on the streets.

65
00:05:19,078 --> 00:05:23,797
And the 15M did that. It did it
because it made the right diagnostic.

66
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:28,377
In this country there is an economic crisis,
but most of all there is a political crisis.

67
00:05:28,378 --> 00:05:31,144
There is what
Martin Luther King said.

68
00:05:31,145 --> 00:05:36,249
And I believe it represents very well
what we are trying to say here.

69
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:40,868
It says  : "when we will remember
this century we are living in,

70
00:05:40,869 --> 00:05:46,139
the greatest tragedy will not be
the strident clamor of the bad people,

71
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:49,909
but the appalling silence
of the good people"

72
00:05:55,734 --> 00:06:02,012
When the protest was over, there were 15 people
that decided to stay at Sol.

73
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:06,455
I believe it was those people
who lighted the fuse.

74
00:06:06,456 --> 00:06:10,701
After the demonstration
I stayed there with a few friends of mine.

75
00:06:10,702 --> 00:06:15,823
There were many others 
that wanted to continue.

76
00:06:15,824 --> 00:06:19,468
So I was going around
when I heard people saying :

77
00:06:19,469 --> 00:06:22,318
"Why don't we stay ?
Why don't we do something else ?"

78
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,503
Just as in the Tarhir Square in Egypt, we wanted
to reclaim the square or something like that.

79
00:06:28,504 --> 00:06:33,300
And someone came with the idea
of camping there, on that square.

80
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:37,960
I was sitting there
and I found this idea amazing.

81
00:06:37,961 --> 00:06:41,763
I joined them and I was there
when everything started

82
00:06:41,764 --> 00:06:44,843
We can do the 
camping here, okay? 

83
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:57,166
We can't put tents, because they will probably
make us leave in two seconds.

84
00:06:57,167 --> 00:06:59,945
But we can put rush mattings, cardboards

85
00:06:59,946 --> 00:07:03,097
or whatever could help us hang in here...
Because the ground is hard.

86
00:07:05,314 --> 00:07:08,786
Who thinks about 
staying here tonight ?

87
00:07:08,787 --> 00:07:12,060
Raise your hands those
of you who will stay !

88
00:07:14,693 --> 00:07:16,513
Alright, there's 
enough people...

89
00:07:18,149 --> 00:07:20,203
Those of you who
cannot stay tonight,

90
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:25,051
but who wish to stay just a while with us
and give us strength, you are welcome.

91
00:07:25,052 --> 00:07:29,194
It would be great if tomorrow,
when some of you must go to work,

92
00:07:29,195 --> 00:07:31,947
others could stay
and maintain the camping.

93
00:07:31,948 --> 00:07:35,027
If just a few can do that, they have
to see there is still something here,

94
00:07:35,028 --> 00:07:38,130
and that we will resist
until the elections.

95
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:43,091
So, those who can stay, 
come closer,

96
00:07:43,092 --> 00:07:47,900
and let's organize ourselves,
we will get a few rush mattings, cardboards.

97
00:07:47,901 --> 00:07:50,869
water, and anything else
we could need, okay ?

98
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,143
The week after, there were going
to be provincial and mayoral elections.

99
00:07:55,144 --> 00:08:00,720
And then we thought : "why don't we stay here,
as a form of protest, until the elections ?"

100
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:03,781
Resist until the day of the elections.
Make as much noise as possible,

101
00:08:03,782 --> 00:08:07,676
bring as much people here as possible
so that it won't be just one demonstration like today.

102
00:08:07,677 --> 00:08:10,591
Resist and create a movement...

103
00:08:13,043 --> 00:08:17,303
Now we have to decide what
we are going to do while we are here,

104
00:08:17,304 --> 00:08:20,351
some people have already
made some suggestions......

105
00:08:21,057 --> 00:08:27,473
First how will we organize ourselves, and then
think at... Most of all, what is our manifest ? 

106
00:08:27,474 --> 00:08:31,704
First it was an exciting moment.

107
00:08:31,705 --> 00:08:34,904
But obviously as we were very few
to stay there the first night,

108
00:08:34,905 --> 00:08:39,091
we didn't really know where all this could lead us
and what consequences it could have.

109
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:44,477
So it was simply like "a new action, a new thing
is happening, how exciting  !"

110
00:08:44,478 --> 00:08:49,051
and we were very focused on how to
organize it so that it would continue.

111
00:08:49,052 --> 00:08:52,311
We call people to join this mobilization
starting from this moment.

112
00:08:52,312 --> 00:08:56,277
Don't wait for tomorrow,
just come now.

113
00:08:56,278 --> 00:08:59,893
And for other cities to take
their squares and do the same.

114
00:08:59,894 --> 00:09:02,833
From the very first night,

115
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:06,025
when we joined together
and we started to write a manifest,

116
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:09,644
when we payed for the webpage
and we started to publish things online,

117
00:09:09,645 --> 00:09:13,661
we payed right away
for the international domain names,

118
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:19,322
thinking that if this would work,
we had to spread it out everywhere.

119
00:09:19,323 --> 00:09:27,434
just as it got to us from the Arab spring,
the Icelandic revolution or other movements..

120
00:09:27,435 --> 00:09:32,092
The global aspect has always been very important,
this movement is not a local one

121
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:36,989
just about our country in today's moment,
it is a universal movement.

122
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:43,369
To all the people in all the countries.
We're truly opening this to everyone.

123
00:09:45,509 --> 00:09:48,548
It's the first time that this
assembly has so many participants.

124
00:09:48,549 --> 00:09:54,250
First of all, we will
establish this day's agenda.

125
00:09:54,251 --> 00:09:58,920
Then we will have a review of the different
commissions that have been working,

126
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:02,577
then we will see if we
should set up the tent.

127
00:10:04,134 --> 00:10:07,701
"Do not stand there watching us, inform yourself,
you too are concerned"

128
00:10:07,792 --> 00:10:12,473
Several commissions were organized
to discuss different topics.

129
00:10:12,474 --> 00:10:18,351
People started to think about topics
and suggest several matters

130
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,481
related to a social change.

131
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:24,249
It's like starting
all over again :

132
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,570
"now we are all here, we are all sick
of everything, we need to do something,

133
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:31,886
the first thing we will do
is to talk to each other,

134
00:10:31,887 --> 00:10:33,787
and express what we want".

135
00:10:33,788 --> 00:10:39,177
So the movement started mostly with this,
with talking, with the assembly.

136
00:10:39,178 --> 00:10:42,459
It was clear from the start,
and no one argued about it,

137
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:45,463
that it was going to be an horizontal movement,
meaning that everyone had to speak ,

138
00:10:45,464 --> 00:10:48,054
and everyone would be
the leader of this movement.

139
00:10:48,055 --> 00:10:53,401
We couldn't have imagined the support we were going to have
and the consequences of this movement.

140
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:57,301
For the few of us that were here last night,
we feel a bit overwhelmed.

141
00:10:57,302 --> 00:11:01,693
So what I mean is that yesterday

142
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:06,800
we thought that setting up a tent was stupid,
but today it truly makes sense.

143
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:10,709
It will draw people's attention
and it will make more people come.

144
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,776
NO TO VIOLENCE !

145
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:30,373
When they evicted us, the second night,
the police wrecked everything.

146
00:11:30,987 --> 00:11:35,212
We then made an announcement asking people 
to come back to the square at 8 p.m,

147
00:11:35,213 --> 00:11:39,284
to camp here again and again,
for as long as it would take.

148
00:11:39,285 --> 00:11:44,315
And a crowd of people came and then
it became this craziness we know.

149
00:11:44,316 --> 00:11:48,361
From that point, it really started to be... something different.

150
00:11:48,362 --> 00:11:52,761
And then we really felt that
it could spread to anywhere.

151
00:12:06,673 --> 00:12:09,782
This is far more than
a concentration of people !

152
00:12:10,288 --> 00:12:13,314
This is an assembly !

153
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:17,208
An assembly means
we are all together !

154
00:12:22,836 --> 00:12:24,725
We are many !

155
00:12:24,726 --> 00:12:27,567
Far more than
what we had imagined.

156
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:38,281
Until now we stood
our ground at Sol !

157
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:42,176
We got organized in groups
and in working commissions.

158
00:12:42,177 --> 00:12:48,454
We have two very important questions
that we would like to ask you all, okay ?

159
00:12:49,717 --> 00:12:51,320
First of all :

160
00:12:51,321 --> 00:12:54,332
do we want to stay 
here tonight ?

161
00:13:18,239 --> 00:13:24,408
All of a sudden everything 
had changed,

162
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:27,451
society, politics,
everything !

163
00:13:27,452 --> 00:13:31,911
From one day to another, everything
had changed or was about to change.

164
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:35,977
We are convening an assembly
tomorrow, and the day after,

165
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:39,153
and every day 
after that, at 8 p.m.

166
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:45,681
Every evening 30.000 people were coming
to the square spontaneously.

167
00:13:45,682 --> 00:13:51,392
We made a call and invited people to come
but there was no logistics to organize them,

168
00:13:51,393 --> 00:13:56,125
nor an official announcement made by
big organizations, nothing.

169
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,849
We had just told them
to come and they came,

170
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:02,545
they wanted to come and they were
staying there for hours,

171
00:14:02,546 --> 00:14:06,831
Nothing concrete was happening,

172
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:09,316
but they just wanted to be there,
to be a part of all this.

173
00:14:09,317 --> 00:14:13,432
Thousands of citizens, and more every day,
have taken the square for four consecutive days.

174
00:14:13,433 --> 00:14:18,013
As you can see and hear,
Puerta del Sol is a hive of activity.

175
00:14:18,014 --> 00:14:20,125
The so called "indignants" of Madrid

176
00:14:20,126 --> 00:14:23,090
assured that they would stay
there as long as necessary. 

177
00:14:23,091 --> 00:14:25,829
Everyone kept coming and
offering their services.

178
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,332
"I want to be a part of this"

179
00:14:28,303 --> 00:14:34,197
"I am a dentist, so I will treat
people's teeth for free".

180
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:37,118
another said : "I am a masseur,
I will give massages",

181
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:39,718
"I am an electrician, I can help
you connect the electric wires".

182
00:14:39,719 --> 00:14:44,250
Everybody was finding something to do
just to be part of it.

183
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:47,665
And then the energy was endless.
There was no way to stop it.

184
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:51,914
We haven't had this feeling
in Spain in a long time,

185
00:14:51,915 --> 00:14:55,512
of being sick of everything,
of being  joined together.

186
00:14:56,213 --> 00:14:57,982
But with no violence.

187
00:15:00,383 --> 00:15:02,774
And in a very open way.

188
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:05,858
The place was covered
by placards with messages !

189
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:10,714
Thousands of placards where people
had written their own claims or ideas.

190
00:15:10,715 --> 00:15:13,429
Seeing this was amazing.

191
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,021
Making people  all of a
sudden understand

192
00:15:17,022 --> 00:15:19,995
how the electoral system works,
well that's a victory.

193
00:15:20,396 --> 00:15:23,373
In order to change things
you have to understand them first.

194
00:15:23,374 --> 00:15:28,336
People in Spain no longer see politics
the same way since the 15M.

195
00:15:28,337 --> 00:15:31,488
They now see it
in a totally different way.

196
00:15:31,489 --> 00:15:34,627
We can consider the 15M
as a sort of popular university.

197
00:15:34,628 --> 00:15:38,846
They've managed to make people discuss
politics and economy in the street,

198
00:15:38,847 --> 00:15:42,178
assemblies that took place 
in the public squares.

199
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:46,216
And that is the purpose,
the 15M should not become a political party.

200
00:15:41,217 --> 00:15:44,463
It's making people 
aware of the truth.

201
00:15:49,464 --> 00:15:52,692
All of a sudden everybody
was talking politics, everywhere.

202
00:15:52,693 --> 00:15:56,220
You walked in the street
and you heard people talking about it.

203
00:15:56,221 --> 00:16:00,264
Thousands of people talking about
the Electoral law for example, about referendums…

204
00:16:00,265 --> 00:16:02,913
It was something new and special !

205
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:07,529
They are doing something that has
never been done in the world.

206
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:11,895
Passively, in a democratic way,
without making problems,

207
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:13,265
and without any intervention
of the police.

208
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:21,230
This is the movement's great success :
giving to older people,

209
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:23,607
and to people of my age,

210
00:16:24,432 --> 00:16:28,168
the feeling that 
everything was not lost. 

211
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:31,410
The 15M had become
the center of everything.

212
00:16:31,411 --> 00:16:34,046
All the news headlines 
were focused on it !

213
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:38,623
Newspapers seem
upset when we don't do anything,

214
00:16:38,979 --> 00:16:41,889
because they are selling less !

215
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:43,766
And these statistics...

216
00:16:43,767 --> 00:16:49,445
80% of the population were supporting
the 15M and the whole movement.

217
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:53,449
I think this is a 
very important thing.

218
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,555
I would like to tell you all
that you have brightened my life.

219
00:16:57,556 --> 00:17:04,192
I was very miserable and all of this here
is very important to me. I love you all !

220
00:17:06,642 --> 00:17:11,343
We will now begin with
the general assembly of Madrid.

221
00:17:11,344 --> 00:17:14,469
The general assembly is an organism
that takes part in all decisions,

222
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:16,984
an organism in which
we all participate,

223
00:17:16,985 --> 00:17:23,163
but we have to be very clear about
what our state of mind will be here.

224
00:17:23,464 --> 00:17:29,407
If we agree on a proposal,

225
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:32,228
we will applaud like this.

226
00:17:35,574 --> 00:17:38,678
This gesture is a veto.

227
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:42,177
A veto is a very powerful
tool in an assembly.

228
00:17:42,178 --> 00:17:47,303
A member of an assembly can use his
right of veto three or four times.

229
00:17:47,304 --> 00:17:52,919
So that nobody here
abuses of this right,

230
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:56,949
unless they have a radically
opposed opinion.

231
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,594
The formal aspect is very essential.
So that people can rethink everything,

232
00:17:58,595 --> 00:18:01,537
and that everything is open
to discussion and to change.

233
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:10,263
This distinguishes us from
any political party, from organized,

234
00:18:10,264 --> 00:18:14,384
vertical institutions, where changing things
is much more difficult.

235
00:18:14,385 --> 00:18:21,092
At first, the 15M was mostly a methodological movement
that was asking for a change of methods.

236
00:18:21,093 --> 00:18:25,579
Whether you are right wing,
left wing or a liberal :

237
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:30,429
in fact we were all demanding an improvement
of the way our society was administrated.

238
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,323
From my point of view,
this is what the movement was asking for.

239
00:18:34,959 --> 00:18:40,535
When it moved to the street,
and the assemblies started,

240
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:46,416
it lost part of its methodological aspect
and it turned more into an ideological movement,

241
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,396
focused on left-wing suggestions,

242
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:52,504
that can be a good or bad thing 
but that don't suit everybody.

243
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:57,480
In the campings or the assemblies, 
you stop seeing

244
00:18:58,202 --> 00:19:05,217
liberal and right-wing people.

245
00:19:05,218 --> 00:19:06,803
They were almost rejected.

246
00:19:06,804 --> 00:19:10,012
Even if it was not said,
the environment was hostile to them.

247
00:19:11,013 --> 00:19:15,813
There's a part of the movement that believes
in the representative democracy, the liberal democracy,

248
00:19:15,814 --> 00:19:18,060
that accepts the parliamentary logics,

249
00:19:18,761 --> 00:19:22,900
that believes it's important to reform
the Spanish electoral system, so unfair.

250
00:19:23,444 --> 00:19:27,798
There is a second position of those
who defend the participative democracy,

251
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:35,023
that accept how the liberal democracy orks,
but believe new elements have to be implemanted

252
00:19:35,024 --> 00:19:38,978
in order to revive 
this dying democracy :

253
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:44,155
participative budgets,
frequents referendums…

254
00:19:44,156 --> 00:19:49,280
And there is a third position that defends
direct democracy, non delegated,

255
00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:55,946
that considers that the main mission
of this movement is to define independent spaces,

256
00:19:55,947 --> 00:20:03,841
so that the self managing assembly rules everything,
without any external representations.

257
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:09,340
I am not in a position to say
which one of these has the greatest echo.

258
00:20:09,341 --> 00:20:13,259
But I do believe it is the third one
that makes this movement singular.

259
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,090
We went beyond the forecasts
of participation in the neighborhoods.

260
00:20:21,516 --> 00:20:24,066
Welcome comrades !

261
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,324
From Villa Verde, welcome...

262
00:20:25,325 --> 00:20:26,525
From Malasaña...

263
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:28,159
Comrades from Columbia, welcome !

264
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,276
A comrade representing... 

265
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:36,590
The camping itself
didn't have a way out.

266
00:20:36,591 --> 00:20:40,042
It was impossible to stop this.
To go where ?

267
00:20:40,043 --> 00:20:44,811
We are camping here and now what ?
The way out were neighborhoods.

268
00:20:45,732 --> 00:20:48,925
The assembly moved into the neighborhoods,

269
00:20:49,269 --> 00:20:56,992
which makes even more sense to me
because your daily life is in your neighborhood,

270
00:20:56,993 --> 00:21:00,422
in your home, 
in the places you shop,

271
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:05,301
in the parks you go to.

272
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:10,261
And in the end this was the final
purpose of all this movement :

273
00:21:10,262 --> 00:21:13,989
taking part in democracy,
the participative democracy,

274
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,143
deciding things
that affect us all.

275
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:21,063
It's been three weeks since 
we've been here. In Madrid !

276
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:25,629
In Puerta del Sol, in the heart of the state,
in the heart of this city.

277
00:21:27,804 --> 00:21:31,086
Camping is a tool.

278
00:21:31,487 --> 00:21:35,758
It's a work tool,
it's not an end in itself.

279
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:46,097
It's obvious camping was
a good work tool for this movement.

280
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:51,610
Now it is time to end this camping
and work in the neighborhoods of Madrid !

281
00:21:53,367 --> 00:21:57,851
The assemblies have reduced since then.
There are 30, 40 people now.

282
00:21:57,852 --> 00:22:02,916
Today if you compare an assembly to one
from 2011 you can see a big difference.

283
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:06,090
Because we evolve 
and we learn,

284
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:09,733
we are learning about
this new democratic culture.

285
00:22:09,734 --> 00:22:13,164
Still, we didn't go
very far on some points.

286
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,983
For example, the internal way
of functioning was through assemblies.

287
00:22:16,984 --> 00:22:20,663
But these assemblies
lacked of imagination.

288
00:22:20,664 --> 00:22:26,894
Only a limited number of people
could participate, 1.000 people, maybe more,

289
00:22:26,895 --> 00:22:30,157
but there was no way 10.000, 100.000
or 200.000 could participate.

290
00:22:30,158 --> 00:22:33,956
But we want to reach
those level of participation,

291
00:22:33,957 --> 00:22:37,417
because we want to redefine 
everything, redefine the State.

292
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:40,223
So if we are 50 million people
to speak, how do we do that ?

293
00:22:40,224 --> 00:22:44,533
I think we have to take the power.
Said like this, it might make you smile.

294
00:22:48,061 --> 00:22:52,656
But we need to do it in a horizontal way.
Find a sort of horizontal organization,

295
00:22:52,695 --> 00:22:58,396
that could integrate 
the electoral game.

296
00:22:58,397 --> 00:23:02,298
If we manage not to fall
into despair and sadness,

297
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:07,237
then we will clearly make a change
and create something unbelievable.

298
00:23:07,238 --> 00:23:11,752
The 15M movement cannot die
because it's combat is structural.

299
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:19,228
Squares can be empty, but this state of mind
is still there and the 15M is still there !

300
00:23:19,287 --> 00:23:22,715
As the crisis keeps getting worst,
the 15M will evolve in different ways.

301
00:23:22,716 --> 00:23:25,504
And this is obviously 
something very important.

302
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:29,858
Despite the fact that the government
uses police repression

303
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:32,456
to change people's frustration
into resignation,

304
00:23:32,457 --> 00:23:35,743
the 15M cannot be crushed
by the government.

305
00:23:35,744 --> 00:23:40,521
It will always be there in a latent form, and those 
who are opposed to a radical change are wrong.

306
00:23:40,522 --> 00:23:42,735
Because the radical 
change is inevitable.

307
00:23:42,736 --> 00:23:47,443
The greatest victory is making
people realize that

308
00:23:47,444 --> 00:23:51,618
if you fight, 
you can loose.

309
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,380
But if you don't fight,
then you are lost. 

310
00:23:57,043 --> 00:24:02,495
No one will be surprised not to know
anymore what happened to you, or to me.

311
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:11,282
No one will be surprised to see two faces merging when they gaze
into the same glass wall, in the same spring.

312
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:18,611
And this might bring relief, this might create in other cities,
in other times, euphoria and youth.

313
00:24:19,812 --> 00:24:25,257
This might be a founding reason
for others to come closer together.

314
00:24:24,458 --> 00:24:28,630
We will think of the loved ones,
and at the shedded tears.

315
00:24:28,631 --> 00:24:34,043
We will think of the last disagreements,
of the hard words stuck in our throats,

316
00:24:34,044 --> 00:24:36,577
and we will have the last word.

317
00:24:36,878 --> 00:24:42,709
Ah comrade, don't try to give up your soul,
it would be too heavy to give up anyway.

318
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:47,900
With all of its secrets, your soul of revolt,
nobody would want it anyway.

319
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:53,883
It is too painful, your soul of a thousand wholes,
of a thousand bumps and of a thousand bruises.

320
00:24:53,884 --> 00:24:56,433
It's yours to change 
into a landscape.

321
00:24:58,184 --> 00:25:00,620
Spring is still here.
