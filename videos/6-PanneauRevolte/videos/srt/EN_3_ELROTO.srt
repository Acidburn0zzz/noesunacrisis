1
00:00:02,211 --> 00:00:07,778
ELECTIONS : they could choose side A or side B,
but it was the same tune.

2
00:00:07,779 --> 00:00:09,820
The purpose of my work

3
00:00:09,821 --> 00:00:13,525
is to reinforce 
the reader's opinion.

4
00:00:13,526 --> 00:00:16,090
Reinforce his thought mechanisms.

5
00:00:16,091 --> 00:00:19,958
Not telling him how things are,

6
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:22,970
but helping him understand 
by himself.

7
00:00:22,971 --> 00:00:24,735
I believe that satire today

8
00:00:24,736 --> 00:00:28,974
has to keep in mind 
the fact that the battle

9
00:00:28,975 --> 00:00:33,213
is being fought 

10
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:37,154
inside people's conscience,

11
00:00:37,155 --> 00:00:39,947
more than in economy,
or ideology.

12
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:45,715
And that's where his work is
most important and most difficult too.

13
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:53,149
My name is Andrés Rábago, I am 
better known as El Roto.

14
00:00:53,193 --> 00:00:56,140
I draw for the press 
and paint.

15
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:00,387
I don't know what this is...

16
00:01:12,888 --> 00:01:16,191
One of my ways of working,

17
00:01:17,997 --> 00:01:20,989
is not to think about
the real situation,

18
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:25,149
but to creat metaphors
reflecting that situation.

19
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:33,078
My work doesn't refer 
to the concrete actors,

20
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:39,258
but to the philosophy, the way of thinking
and the interests behind that.

21
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,953
Because the actors come and go.

22
00:01:40,954 --> 00:01:45,186
But the mechanisms, 
they stay.

23
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:51,771
No need for your children to study,
ours are already doing it.

24
00:01:54,553 --> 00:02:00,867
To downsize costs, I have
externalized my conscience.

25
00:02:00,868 --> 00:02:07,562
I work a lot on my texts.
They are very elaborated,

26
00:02:07,607 --> 00:02:10,874
to be very concise,
with very few words.

27
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:13,853
For technical reasons,

28
00:02:13,854 --> 00:02:19,693
because the reader doesn't have
much time to read the paragraphs.

29
00:02:19,694 --> 00:02:22,194
If they are very brief,

30
00:02:22,195 --> 00:02:28,728
they are easier to assimilate
into our storage capacity.

31
00:02:29,129 --> 00:02:32,437
Sometimes I don't even use a single word,
like in this case for example.

32
00:02:32,438 --> 00:02:35,565
These drawings are more complicated to do,

33
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:39,576
because words always 
make my job easier.

34
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:45,008
Aspecially in daily work, drawing without
any words would be very difficult.

35
00:02:45,009 --> 00:02:48,266
Words are precious.

36
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:55,082
- What a disgrace, the markets are forcing us to apply some policies
that we already wanted to apply. - Oh my God !

37
00:02:56,027 --> 00:02:59,061
The financial power works
for the political power,

38
00:02:59,062 --> 00:03:02,578
just as the political power
works for the financial one.

39
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:07,033
They have the same interests.

40
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:12,867
I'm sorry my friends : social conquests
were only temporary concessions.

41
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:17,222
I think they are 
trying to dismantle

42
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:19,958
everything that has been built.

43
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,801
Meaning that, there is a very clear ideological
component in the way of governing.

44
00:03:24,802 --> 00:03:28,319
It is not so much 
an economic issue,

45
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,674
as an ideological one.

46
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:34,367
That's not happening just in Spain.

47
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:36,993
What is happening in Spain

48
00:03:36,994 --> 00:03:41,906
comes from the 
anglo-saxon world,

49
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:50,230
and it is putting 
Spain to the test,

50
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:58,226
but also other countries that
don't have a good ability to react.

51
00:03:58,227 --> 00:04:01,232
But Spain is a 
experimental zone,

52
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:04,115
the same thing will be done
in other places.

53
00:04:04,116 --> 00:04:07,754
So people from other European 
countries shouldn't look at us,

54
00:04:07,755 --> 00:04:10,597
saying "poor people
with their problems",

55
00:04:10,598 --> 00:04:12,878
because this problem 
we have today,

56
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,147
will soon be everyone's problem
in these countries.

57
00:04:17,148 --> 00:04:21,787
This is a social counter-revolution.
It is a true social counter-revolution.

58
00:04:24,126 --> 00:04:28,010
We could have a different policy
but it is paid less.

59
00:04:28,011 --> 00:04:33,322
This character doesn't have a face.

60
00:04:33,323 --> 00:04:39,419
That financial sector without a face,
we don't know who is behind it.

61
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,667
Who are they ? The banks...

62
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:44,002
Who are the banks ?

63
00:04:44,003 --> 00:04:45,137
It's a secret...

64
00:04:45,638 --> 00:04:51,727
I represent the allegory of power
through unrecognizable people.

65
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:57,019
I am not interested in wasting paint
on them, because they are not worth it.

66
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,629
They are not worth the paint
or the paper I use.

67
00:05:02,353 --> 00:05:06,430
What kind of financiers are they,
who need to be financed ?

68
00:05:08,131 --> 00:05:14,131
To the 15M young people : found a party
and we will finance you to be just like the others.

69
00:05:14,132 --> 00:05:21,982
I believe the political class is a sort of mirror
of the general situation of this country.

70
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:26,509
Politicians are not aliens,
they are born here, trained here,

71
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:33,162
and their mind is made of thoughts and moral values
that reflect the general population.

72
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:37,329
I don't think we have on one side
the corrupted political class

73
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:42,145
and on the other side the social class,
the population who is pure.

74
00:05:42,146 --> 00:05:47,446
I think the responsibility
belongs to all of us.

75
00:05:47,447 --> 00:05:53,605
We cannot always say
it is their fault.

76
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:56,085
I believe there is a social
responsibility in all of this.

77
00:05:56,586 --> 00:06:03,632
Basically I think we refuse
to look at our own behaviors.

78
00:06:03,633 --> 00:06:07,952
We look at what others do,
but we don't see what we do.

79
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:10,238
This is why I think
we need this reflection,

80
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:17,361
this critical look 
on our own actions.

81
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:22,732
And my drawings are often
trying to denounce this.

82
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:26,001
Let's say I'm trying to stimulate
our capacity to analyze,

83
00:06:26,802 --> 00:06:30,215
not just the external things,

84
00:06:30,216 --> 00:06:37,250
but our own ways of understanding
and seeing ourselves,

85
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:41,448
so that we can take 
better care of our lives. 

86
00:06:43,953 --> 00:06:47,998
Nothing man, nothing ! The juvenile unemployment
will be fixed with time.

87
00:06:49,463 --> 00:06:51,515
Bankers

88
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,865
Economy

89
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:06,522
At school they teach us to read,
to write and to scour through garbage.

90
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:11,470
There is some kind of 
brutality in the form,

91
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:16,151
but the content of my work 
is an affectionate one.

92
00:07:16,152 --> 00:07:21,738
An affectionate content behind
an appearance of coldness.

93
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:27,654
Do you remember when the world had an horizon ?
- How was it, daddy ?

94
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:36,697
The operation was a success : we managed to make it look like
a crisis, when it was actually a sacking !
