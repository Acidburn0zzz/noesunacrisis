1
00:00:05,558 --> 00:00:06,839
Spaniards !

2
00:00:08,465 --> 00:00:10,163
Franco...

3
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:11,886
...is dead.

4
00:00:14,016 --> 00:00:18,747
36 years of dictatorship has ended

5
00:00:25,515 --> 00:00:31,026
The 6th of December 1978,
Spaniards return to vote

6
00:00:31,027 --> 00:00:33,282
to approve the new Constitution. 

7
00:00:52,085 --> 00:00:54,780
A military coup attempt

8
00:00:54,815 --> 00:00:57,421
I have ordered
civil authorities

9
00:00:57,422 --> 00:01:00,414
and all the chiefs
of the General Staff,

10
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:03,146
to take the necessary measures

11
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:06,482
in order to maintain
the constitutional order

12
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:08,167
within the law.

13
00:01:15,048 --> 00:01:17,464
We organized
in transparency

14
00:01:17,465 --> 00:01:20,270
the third general elections.

15
00:01:20,271 --> 00:01:24,614
and more than a party's victory,

16
00:01:24,615 --> 00:01:27,185
it is the victory of democracy
and of the Spanish people. 

17
00:01:27,186 --> 00:01:31,001
Election of the socialist
Felipe González

18
00:01:31,002 --> 00:01:35,378
Official ending
the democratic transition

19
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:45,033
This country's transition period,
was presented as a democratization.

20
00:01:45,034 --> 00:01:48,327
But the truth is that Franco
died in his bed.

21
00:01:49,528 --> 00:01:53,799
And no true separation
of powers was made,

22
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,800
justice is not independent,
it is tied to the political power,

23
00:01:57,801 --> 00:02:02,311
members of the General Council of Justice
are named by political parties.

24
00:02:02,312 --> 00:02:05,720
Nobody went to jail for having
established this military dictatorship .

25
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:08,183
The ones in power who
defended Franco's dictatorship,

26
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:10,803
are still in power,
defending democracy.

27
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:13,866
And this is being maintained,
it is like a legacy.

28
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:17,655
So there has never been a revolution,
there has never been a break

29
00:02:17,656 --> 00:02:22,808
as in other countries.
Not even as in Portugal or Greece.

30
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,444
We've inherited Franco's way
of making politics.

31
00:02:26,445 --> 00:02:31,111
It is the same form, with corruption,
client networks, it is the same.

32
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:34,303
The Spanish Popular Party is shaking.

33
00:02:34,304 --> 00:02:38,409
The so-called "bonus scandal" got to the
ruling party's head office.

34
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:44,422
Thursday, around 500 people were demonstrating
in front of the siege, on Genova street,

35
00:02:44,423 --> 00:02:48,188
requesting explanations
regarding the bonus scandal,

36
00:02:48,189 --> 00:02:52,982
in which several members of the Popular Party's head office,
including Prime Minister Rajoy, would be involved. 

37
00:02:53,013 --> 00:02:55,801
It is a corrupt, incompetent political class,

38
00:02:55,802 --> 00:02:57,560
selfish...

39
00:02:59,472 --> 00:03:01,785
and deceiving.

40
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:07,000
If there's really a crisis in Spain,

41
00:03:07,001 --> 00:03:09,621
if there is something we can actually call crisis,
then it's a political crisis.

42
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:15,974
It is the political class
 of this country

43
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:18,586
that has totally let down 
the people's hopes.

44
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:21,561
In September 2011,

45
00:03:21,562 --> 00:03:24,178
the Constitution was reformed.

46
00:03:24,679 --> 00:03:28,037
It was the first reform since 1978,

47
00:03:28,038 --> 00:03:33,460
a rushed reform, required by the European Union,
that states that

48
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:37,493
the public administration debts 
towards private entities

49
00:03:37,494 --> 00:03:42,361
become a priority to any 
other kind of expense.

50
00:03:42,362 --> 00:03:43,750
In other words,

51
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:49,385
health and education are secondary
among our government's priorities.

52
00:03:49,386 --> 00:03:55,204
This reform was supported by the Popular Party,
the conservative right-wing party,

53
00:03:55,205 --> 00:03:56,753
but also by the Socialist party.

54
00:03:56,754 --> 00:04:02,676
I believe this explains
very well people's critical attitude

55
00:04:02,677 --> 00:04:07,702
towards the Spanish 
political class. 

56
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:11,823
When we asked for more democracy,
we wanted to change things,

57
00:04:11,824 --> 00:04:15,730
they told us, "you cannot have more democracy,
the Constitution is untouchable".

58
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:20,345
And all of a sudden one summer they changed it
so that they could pay the debt to foreign countries.

59
00:04:20,346 --> 00:04:22,503
It was the exact opposite
of our request !

60
00:04:22,504 --> 00:04:27,863
... first police charges.
There was a call for a protest.

61
00:04:27,864 --> 00:04:30,324
1.500 anti-riot agents 
are protecting the area.

62
00:04:30,325 --> 00:04:34,931
We have also seen people throwing
objects to the anti-riot agents.

63
00:04:35,632 --> 00:04:40,047
You can also see injured people.

64
00:04:40,048 --> 00:04:43,334
I repeat, these images are live from the
Neptuno Square, right next to the Congress.

65
00:04:43,335 --> 00:04:49,047
As we said, the Congress area 
is totally closed off.

66
00:05:03,698 --> 00:05:10,889
Yes, yes, yes !
Let's go to the Congress !

67
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:17,143
No vote ! No vote !

68
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:23,687
We are in a real mess !
With this governement !

69
00:05:27,986 --> 00:05:31,166
Less police !
More education !

70
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:36,459
The Parliament and the system,
ever since the 15 of May,

71
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:43,151
have to find solutions, because everything that 
was done before is over now.

72
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,238
No, no, no !
They don't represent us !

73
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:01,022
I think this cannot
be called democracy,

74
00:06:01,023 --> 00:06:03,822
or it is a very
sick democracy,

75
00:06:04,568 --> 00:06:08,126
an imitation of democracy,
a hologram that looks like democracy,

76
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:13,006
but it has so many flaws that if 
you pass your hand through it,

77
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:15,810
this is the only thing you see :
a hologram, not a democracy.

78
00:06:15,811 --> 00:06:17,779
Officially we are a democracy :

79
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,770
we can vote, we have
members of Congress,

80
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:24,294
but as citizens we cannot
 decide of anything.

81
00:06:24,295 --> 00:06:26,545
Citizens cannot decide
over health, education,

82
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:30,716
pensions, salaries.

83
00:06:30,717 --> 00:06:34,701
These matters are being decided
by supranational institutions

84
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:38,689
like the Troïka, big companies,
the European Central Bank, rich people. 

85
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,996
A few years ago, there was
this ironic campaign in Spain

86
00:06:42,669 --> 00:06:47,487
for Emilio Botín,
the president of the Santander bank

87
00:06:47,488 --> 00:06:50,511
to become directly
the Prime Minister.

88
00:06:50,512 --> 00:06:53,012
Since he was already
dictating the game rules,

89
00:06:53,013 --> 00:06:55,326
why continue with the
practical joke of elections ?

90
00:06:55,327 --> 00:06:58,037
That ironic campaign draw clearly

91
00:06:58,038 --> 00:07:00,847
the attention on a 
very important issue.

92
00:07:00,848 --> 00:07:03,597
In this country, that was 
not industrialized,

93
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:06,381
that lost its industry
when entering the EU,

94
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:08,625
the public companies 
were privatized.

95
00:07:08,626 --> 00:07:10,328
The public bank was privatized.

96
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,357
And we remained with 
this deprived State,

97
00:07:13,858 --> 00:07:16,465
without any capacity 
of managing economy.

98
00:07:16,466 --> 00:07:20,944
And when a Prime Minister like Zapatero came
and tried to manage the crisis,

99
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:24,793
we realized we had no tools
to fight the crisis.

100
00:07:24,794 --> 00:07:26,761
He could no longer 
use the public bank,

101
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:28,639
He could no longer 
use the public companies.

102
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:33,416
The only thing left 
was begging the banks

103
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:35,227
to be nice to the people.

104
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:38,908
That's proof of
the lack of economic democracy

105
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:42,117
because the economic resources
are held by a minority.

106
00:07:42,118 --> 00:07:44,376
And so a minority
decides of everything.

107
00:07:44,677 --> 00:07:50,049
I come to this tribune to ask 
for a citizen rescue plan.

108
00:07:50,084 --> 00:07:54,646
A rescue plan for the people instead of
a rescue plan for the banks

109
00:07:54,647 --> 00:07:58,070
as approved by this government.

110
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:01,883
Unfortunately I am doing this 
from a devalued desk.

111
00:08:01,884 --> 00:08:05,798
This desk here is devalued
just as this Assembly is.

112
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,656
This Assembly, this desk,

113
00:08:07,657 --> 00:08:10,612
that used to be the symbols
of national sovereignty,

114
00:08:10,613 --> 00:08:16,937
the symbols of the crystallization
of this country's dreams of democracy.

115
00:08:16,938 --> 00:08:21,360
And we can say with conviction
and honesty that above all,

116
00:08:21,361 --> 00:08:29,052
this was the place where people used to debate
the project of society the country wanted.

117
00:08:29,053 --> 00:08:31,266
What have we left today ?

118
00:08:31,267 --> 00:08:34,887
Unfortunately, all we have left is
the appearance of what it used to be.

119
00:08:34,888 --> 00:08:40,683
Because we are aware that today
we are not living in a democracy,

120
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:48,632
that we don't have the tools to decide
how we want to organize our society,

121
00:08:48,633 --> 00:08:51,838
because those decisions
are taken by other authorities,

122
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,056
to which, we citizens,
don't have access.

123
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:56,529
We have to rebuild our institutions.

124
00:08:56,530 --> 00:09:00,356
And to do that
we need a new Constitution,

125
00:09:00,357 --> 00:09:04,663
that gives citizens these tools.

126
00:09:04,664 --> 00:09:08,115
Just like in Iceland,
a representative example,

127
00:09:08,116 --> 00:09:11,192
where the citizens
have risen against

128
00:09:11,193 --> 00:09:15,452
the need to save the banks
and to socialize the debt.

129
00:09:15,453 --> 00:09:18,933
This is exactly what
we have to do here.

130
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,078
Being able to write a wiki-constitution,
just like in Iceland,

131
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:30,128
a Constitution that every citizen could
amend online, I find that genius.

132
00:09:30,214 --> 00:09:32,131
But of course, 
this country is a laboratory,

133
00:09:32,132 --> 00:09:35,736
with 270.000 people
that practically all know each other.

134
00:09:35,737 --> 00:09:38,867
They all have the 
same family tree.

135
00:09:39,068 --> 00:09:44,646
It's not easy to do the same 
in a bigger country.

136
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:46,572
But we have 
to keep that in mind.

137
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:52,059
We can no longer accept that
a citizen's only role in democracy

138
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:55,481
is putting a piece of paper
in a ballot box every four years.
