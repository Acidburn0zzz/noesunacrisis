00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:13,935
Ten years ago we used to talk about 
the Spanish economic miracle. 

2
00:00:13,536 --> 00:00:17,442
Then we abruply went 
from miracle to misery.

3
00:00:22,292 --> 00:00:25,330
You have to mobilize yourself !
Okay ?

4
00:00:30,921 --> 00:00:32,445
PUBLIC HEALTH...

5
00:00:32,446 --> 00:00:34,751
… WE DON'T SELL IT, 
WE DEFEND IT !

6
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:42,797
I don't think it's a crisis but a true depression
that will go beyond the one of 1929.

7
00:00:42,898 --> 00:00:46,764
And that is the government's fault !

8
00:00:46,765 --> 00:00:51,969
I think they are trying to dismantle
everything that has been built.

9
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,003
It's the same policy as in Greece,

10
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:59,491
a policy that leads to 
economic and social suicide.

11
00:00:59,492 --> 00:01:02,191
We must keep our strength !

12
00:01:02,192 --> 00:01:05,965
We have to continue until
they ask for negotiations. 

13
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:11,396
Austerity is not the only alternative.

14
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:14,198
We can't go on like this,
and people are aware of that now.

15
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:17,063
We shouldn't pay a large 
part of the Spanish debt. 

16
00:01:17,164 --> 00:01:22,082
We don't allow any more evictions !

17
00:01:22,483 --> 00:01:26,236
The crisis may be the perfect
 excuse to recreate

18
00:01:26,237 --> 00:01:28,865
the 19th century society,
a society of rich and poor people.

19
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,416
Our country is clearly going 
to the Third-World.

20
00:01:32,417 --> 00:01:35,042
It's a sacking, a swindle, a robbery !

21
00:01:35,043 --> 00:01:37,486
Here are the options
to qualify this crisis...

22
00:01:37,812 --> 00:01:42,346
In this country there is an economic crisis,
but most of all there is a political crisis.

23
00:01:42,347 --> 00:01:45,990
A radical political change cannot be avoided.
The question is : how far should we go ? 

24
00:01:45,991 --> 00:01:51,574
No, no, no !
They don't represent us !

25
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:59,187
We haven't had this feeling
in Spain in a long time.

26
00:01:59,188 --> 00:02:03,032
We felt the indignants movement
could go very far.

27
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,963
Neighbor !

28
00:02:04,964 --> 00:02:08,888
Listen ! We are at war !

29
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:12,329
Nobody had managed to make so many different
people get out on the streets.

30
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,089
And the 15M did that. 

31
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,650
This is the most
remarkable event in Spain

32
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:20,893
since the death
of Franco in 1975.

33
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:24,316
No, no, no !
We are not afraid !

34
00:02:24,617 --> 00:02:27,306
If you fight, 
you can loose.

35
00:02:27,307 --> 00:02:29,941
But if you don't fight,
then you are lost. 

36
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:35,455
It's very very important that you go
to your neighborhood assemblies.

37
00:02:41,471 --> 00:02:44,682
Calling what is happening crisis

38
00:02:44,683 --> 00:02:46,412
is part of the lure,
and part of the lie.
